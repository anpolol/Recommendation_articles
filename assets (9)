Motivated by elasticity theory, we introduce a Lagrangian expressed algebraically (without differentiations) via our pair of metrics. Analysis of the resulting nonlinear field equations produces three main results. Firstly, we show that for Ricci-flat manifolds our linearised field equations are Maxwell's equations in the Lorenz gauge with exact current. Secondly, for Minkowski space we construct explicit massless solutions of our nonlinear field equations; these come in two distinct types, right-handed and left-handed. Thirdly, for Minkowski space we construct explicit massive solutions of our nonlinear field equations; these contain a positive parameter which has the geometric meaning of quantum mechanical mass and a real parameter which may be interpreted as electric charge. In constructing explicit solutions of nonlinear field equations we resort to group-theoretic ideas: we identify special 4-dimensional subgroups of the Poincare group and seek diffeomorphisms compatible with their action, in a suitable sense.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1063/1.5140425","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-07-27T14:17:12.133Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"Z/HL2vMpTyiW3YqgNUslgA==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"61001569d112b718099599cb"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"Gh1dVNh/Q1aarwaumfYixQ==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"Fragmentation norm and relative quasimorphisms","authors":["Michael Brandenbursky","Jarek Kkedra"],"date":{"$date":"2018-07-27T00:00:00.000Z"},"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.06592.pdf","abstract":"We prove that manifolds with complicated enough fundamental group admit measure-preserving homeomorphisms which have positive stable fragmentation norm with respect to balls of bounded measure.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1090/PROC/14683","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-07-27T14:17:13.468Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"Z/HL2vMpTyiW3YqgNUslgA==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"61001569d112b718099599cc"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"zx4x0WnuSymLj+vy9MolDQ==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"Vanishing Distance Phenomena and the Geometric Approach to SQG","authors":["Martin Bauer","P.

A purely geometric pathway (involving complete lifts and vertical representatives) is proposed, which establishes a link from particle motion to evolution of the field variables. This pathway is free from Poisson brackets and Hamiltonian functionals. Momentum realizations (sections on T*T*Q) of (both compressible and incompressible) Euler’s fluid and Vlasov’s plasma are derived. Poisson mappings relating the momentum realizations with the usual field equations are constructed as duals of injective Lie algebra homomorphisms. The geometric pathway is then used to construct the evolution equations for 10-moments kinetic theory. This way the entire Grad hierarchy (including entropic fields) can be constructed in a purely geometric way. This geometric way is an alternative to the usual Hamiltonian approach to mechanics based on Poisson brackets.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.3390/e21090907","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-07-27T14:17:13.999Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"Z/HL2vMpTyiW3YqgNUslgA==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6100156ad112b718099599ce"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"2zzb5CmESWuB4NyKhYxpcA==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"Can we run to infinity?

Reduction at zero momentum yields the identification of coadjoint orbits with Grassmannians of isotropic volume submanifolds, slightly generalizing the results in Weinstein [1990] and Lee [2009]. At the other extreme, the case of a nondegenerate momentum recovers the identification of connected components of the nonlinear symplectic Grassmannian with coadjoint orbits, thereby recovering the result of Haller and Vizman [2004]. We also comment on the intermediate cases which correspond to new classes of coadjoint orbits. The description of these coadjoint orbits as well as their orbit symplectic form is obtained in a systematic way by exploiting the general properties of dual pairs of momentum maps.

M. Cahen and S. Gutt showed that the action of the group of Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms on this space is Hamiltonian and calculated the moment map. This is analogous to, but distinct from, the action of Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms on the space of compatible almost complex structures that motivates study of extremal Kahler metrics. In particular, moment constant connections are critical, where a symplectic connection is \\textit{critical} if it is critical, with respect to arbitrary variations, for the $L^{2}$-norm of the Cahen-Gutt moment map. This occurs if and only if the Hamiltonian vector field generated by its moment map image is an infinitesimal automorphism of the symplectic connection. This paper develops the study of moment constant and critical symplectic connections, following, to the extent possible, the analogy with the similar, but different, setting of constant scalar curvature and extremal Kahler metrics. \nIt focuses on the special context of critical symplectic connections on surfaces, for which general structural results are obtained, although some results about the higher-dimensional case are included as well. For surfaces, projectively flat and preferred symplectic connections are critical, and the relations between these and other related conditions are examined in detail.

The algorithm represents 3-D images as 4-D manifolds in a Riemannian space (referred to as embedded maps). Registration is performed as a surface evolution matching one embedded map to another using a diffusion process. The approach differs from those existing in that it takes an a priori estimation of image regions where topological changes are present, for example lesions, and generates a dense vector field representing both the shape and intensity changes necessary to match the images. The algorithm outputs both a diffeomorphic deformation field and an intensity displacement which corrects the intensity difference caused by topological changes. Multiple sets of experiments are conducted on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with lesions from OASIS and ADNI datasets. These images are registered to either a brain template or images of healthy individuals. An exemplar case registering a template to an MRI with tumor is also given. The resulting deformation fields were compared with those obtained using diffeomorphic demons, where topological changes are not modeled. These sets of experiments demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed REM method for registration of brain MRI with severe topological differences.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1109/TMI.2011.2178609","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-07-27T14:17:44.189Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"Z/HL2vMpTyiW3YqgNUslgA==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"61001588d112b71809959a01"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"trRgV/BVRiCIdpqpvEZJjQ==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"Submanifolds and the Hofer norm","authors":["Michael Usher"],"date":{"$date":"2012-07-27T00:00:00.000Z"},"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1201.2926.pdf","abstract":"Chekanov showed that the Hofer norm on the Hamiltonian diffeomorphism group of a geometrically bounded symplectic manifold induces a nondegenerate metric on the orbit of any compact Lagrangian submanifold under the group.

Based on these results, we provide positive answers to two questions posed by Arnold in [The asymptotic Hopf invariant and its applications. Selecta Math. Soviet. 5(4) (1986), 327–345]. In the presence of a regular contact form that is also preserved, the helicity extends to an invariant of an isotopy of volume-preserving homeomorphisms, and is invariant under conjugation by volume-preserving homeomorphisms.

The extent to which the Smale Conjecture extends to larger classes of three-manifolds—usually in a limited form called the Weak Smale Conjecture, if at all—is detailed. The chapter closes with a brief discussion of why Perelman’s methods appear not to give progress on the Smale Conjecture. As noted in the Preface, theSmale Conjecture is the assertion that the inclusion \\(\\mathrm{Isom}(M) \\rightarrow \\mathrm{Diff}(M)\\) is a homotopy equivalence whenever M is an elliptic three-manifold, that is, a three-manifold with a Riemannian metric of constant positive curvature (which may be assumed to be 1). TheGeometrization Conjecture, now proven byPerelman, shows that all closed three-manifolds with finite fundamental group are elliptic.In this chapter, we will first review elliptic three-manifolds and their isometry groups. In the second section, we will state our main results on the Smale Conjecture, and provide some historical context. In the final two sections, we discuss isometries of nonelliptic three-manifolds, and address the possibility of applying Perelman’s methods to the Smale Conjecture.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1007/978-3-642-31564-0_1","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-07-27T14:17:58.028Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"Z/HL2vMpTyiW3YqgNUslgA==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"61001596d112b71809959a08"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"g9Xb5AHkR8uBPu4NB9bigA==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"The Cremona group in two variables","authors":["Serge Cantat"],"date":{"$date":"2012-07-27T00:00:00.000Z"},"pdf_url":"https://doi.org/10.4171/120-1%2F12","abstract":"We survey a few results concerning the Cremona group in two variables. 2010 Mathematics Subject Classification.

Palais and J. Cerf shows that the map sending a diffeomorphism to its restriction to an imbedding of a submanifold is a locally trivial fibration of the spaces of mappings involved. In this chapter, this theorem is extended to other maps between spaces of mappings, in particular to the map sending each fiber-preserving diffeomorphism of a bundle to the diffeomorphism it induces on the base manifold. Versions with boundary control are obtained, as well as versions for singular fiberings, a class that includes Seifert-fibered three-manifolds. A final section gives a proof that sending the space of diffeomorphisms of a singularly fibered manifold to its space of cosets by the subgroup of fiber-preserving diffeomorphisms is a fibration. This coset space may be regarded as the space of fibered structures diffeomorphic to the given one.R. Palais (Comment. Math. Helv. 34:305–312, 1960) proved a very useful result relating diffeomorphisms and embeddings. For closed M, it says that if \\(W \\subseteq V\\) are submanifolds of M, then the mappings \\(\\mathrm{Diff}(M) \\rightarrow \\mathrm{Emb}(V,M)\\) and \\(\\mathrm{Emb}(V,M) \\rightarrow \\mathrm{Emb}(W,M)\\) obtained by restricting diffeomorphisms and embeddings are locally trivial, and hence are Serre fibrations. The same results, with variants for manifolds with boundary and more complicated additional boundary structure, were proven by J. Cerf (Bull. Soc. Math. Fr. 89:227–380, 1961). Among various applications of these results, the Isotopy Extension Theorem follows by lifting a path in \\(\\mathrm{Emb}(V,M)\\) starting at the inclusion map of V to a path in \\(\\mathrm{Diff}(M)\\) starting at \\({1}_{M}\\). Moreover, parameterized versions of isotopy extension follow just as easily from the homotopy lifting property for \\(\\mathrm{Diff}(M) \\rightarrow \\mathrm{Emb}(V,M)\\) (see Corollary 3.3).In this chapter, we will extend the theorem of Palais in various ways.

In such cases a class of suboptimal Kalman filter implementations called extended Kalman filters (EKF) are used. EKFs operate by linearizing the nonlinear model around the current reference trajectory and then designing the Kalman filter gain for the linearized model. Recently, an alternative approach has emerged for a certain class of problems where the error in the states is estimated using a Kalman filter, rather than the state itself. This error state KF (ErKF) approach, by deriving the error state dynamics, via the perturbation of the nonlinear plant, lends itself to optimal updates in the error states and optimal prediction and updates in the error state covariance. This is because the error state dynamics are linear, thereby satisfying a condition for optimal Kalman filtering. This paper offers a comparison between the EKF and ErKF via simulations and shows that the ErKF performance is robust to a variety of aircraft maneuvers performed. Furthermore, this paper shows that the ErKF, unlike the EKF, need not be repeatedly tuned with respect to the noise covariances in order to obtain acceptable estimation performance.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.2514/6.2011-6615","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-07-27T14:18:03.779Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"Z/HL2vMpTyiW3YqgNUslgA==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6100159dd112b71809959a18"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"H3DqUfAiRsqXWnPzYzkNMg==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"Direct Limits of Infinite-Dimensional Lie Groups","authors":["H.

Change in image appearance due to pose change is realized as navigating a low dimensional submanifold of the infinite dimensional Lie group of diffeomorphisms of the two dimensional sphere S2. For small changes in pose, image motion flow vectors lie on the tangent space of the submanifold.

Mat. 36 (1972), 1296–1320] states that given a manifold M, a Lie group G, a transitive Anosov diffeomorphism f on M and a Hölder function η:M↦G whose range is sufficiently close to the identity, it is sufficient for the existence of ϕ:M↦G satisfying η(x)=ϕ(f(x))ϕ(x)−1 that a condition—obviously necessary—on the cocycle generated by η restricted to periodic orbits is satisfied. In this paper we present a new proof of the main result. These methods allow us to treat cocycles taking values in the group of diffeomorphisms of a compact manifold.

Let D + (M) denote the group of orientation-preserving diffeomorphisms of M endowed with the compact-open C ∞ topology and let D(M; w) denote the subgroup of ω-preserving diffeomorphisms of M. In this paper we propose a unified approach for realization of mass transfer toward ends by diffeomorphisms of M. This argument, together with Moser's theorem, enables us to deduce two selection theorems for the groups D + (M) and D(M;ω). The first one is the extension of Moser's theorem to noncompact manifolds, that is, the existence of sections for the orbit maps under the action of D + (M) on the space of volume forms. This implies that D(M; w) is a strong deformation retract of the group D + (M;E ω M ) consisting of h ∈ D + (M), which preserves the set E ω M of ω-finite ends of M. The second one is related to the mass flow toward ends under volume-preserving diffeomorphisms of M. Let D EM (M; w) denote the subgroup consisting of all h ∈ D(M; ω) which fix the ends E M of M. S. R. Alpern and V. S. Prasad introduced the topological vector space S(M; ω) of end charges of M and the end charge homomorphism c ω : D EM (M; ω) → S(M; ω), which measures the mass flow toward ends induced by each h ∈ D EM (M; ω). We show that the homomorphism c ω has a continuous section.

For the reduced orbifold diffeomorphism group we state and sketch the proof of the following recognition result: Let O1 and O2 be two compact, locally smooth orbifolds. Fix r ≥ 0. Suppose that Φ : Diff (O1) → Diff (O2) is a group isomorphism. Then Φ is induced by red red a (topological) homeomorphism h : X → X That is, Φ(f) = hfh−1 for O1 O2 . r all f ∈ Diff (O1). Furthermore, if r > 0, h is a C manifold diffeomorphism red when restricted to the complement of the singular set of each stratum. We then show that if we replace the reduced orbifold diffeomorphism group by the unre­ duced orbifold diffeomorphism group in the above theorem, we can strengthen the homeomorphism h to an orbifold homeomorphism (orbifold structure preserving). Lastly, we state a structure theorem for the orbifold diffeomorphism group, show­ ing that it is a Banach manifold for 1 ≤ r < ∞ and a Frechet manifold if r = ∞. As a corollary of this we obtain extensions of theorems of the second author to the setting of a smooth, compact orbifold.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1142/9789812777089_0009","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-07-27T14:18:50.888Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"Z/HL2vMpTyiW3YqgNUslgA==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"610015cbd112b71809959a56"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"b2dO99PeT82SxqXHieb9VQ==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"ON SOME ASPECTS OF THE GEOMETRY OF DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS IN PHYSICS","authors":["Xavier Gràcia","M.

Locally conformal symplectic manifolds A locally conformal symplectic manifold, l.c.s. for short, is a triple (M,Ω, ω), where M is a finite dimensional smooth manifold, Ω is a non-degenerate 2-form on M and ω is a closed 1-form on M , such that dΩ = 0, where d : Ω∗(M) → Ω∗+1(M), dα := dα+ ω ∧ α is the Witten deformed differential. We will always assume, that M is connected and ∂M = ∅. Remark 1. The dimension of an l.c.s. manifold has to be even. Since Ω is nowhere vanishing an l.c.s. manifold possesses a canonic orientation. Remark 2. If dim(M) > 2 then ω is uniquely determined by Ω. Indeed if dΩ = d ′ Ω = 0 and ωx 6= ω′ x at a point x ∈ M , then (ω′ x − ωx) ∧ Ωx = 0 and hence Ωx = (ω′ x − ωx)∧ α for some α ∈ T ∗ xM , but this contradicts the non-degeneracy of Ω at the point x. Remark 3. If (Ω, ω) is an l.c.s. structure onM and a ∈ C∞(M,R) then (eΩ, ω−da) is again an l.c.s. structure on M . Two l.c.s. structures (Ω, ω) and (Ω′, ω′) on M are called conformally equivalent if (Ω′, ω′) = (eΩ, ω − da) for some a ∈ C∞(M,R). We will write (Ω, ω) ∼ (Ω′, ω′) in this case. Note that the canonic orientation does only depend on the conformal equivalence class of (M,Ω, ω). Remark 4. Suppose ω is a 1-form on M and consider the trivial line bundle E := M × R → M with the connection ∇Xf := X · f + ω(X)f . For its curvature one easily checks R∇ ω = dω. Via the obvious identification Ω∗(M ;E) = Ω∗(M) the covariant exterior derivative of E-valued differential forms is d∇ ω = d. For closed ω one has dd = 0, corresponding to the fact that the connection ∇ is flat in this case. Moreover, for two 1-forms ω1 and ω2 one has d12(α ∧ β) = (d1α) ∧ β + (−1)|α|α ∧ (d2β), (1) which corresponds to the fact ∇1 ⊗∇2 = ∇12 . 1991 Mathematics Subject Classification. 53D99.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1142/9789812777089_0007","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-07-27T14:18:51.409Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"Z/HL2vMpTyiW3YqgNUslgA==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"610015cbd112b71809959a59"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"SCvGVCmJQE2bxteIz+wl7Q==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"Some properties of locally conformal symplectic structures","authors":["A.

Their special properties are illustrated analytically (by a study of their behaviour with respect to symmetries) and numerically (by a geometric calculation of Lyapunov exponents). We also briefly discuss the non-primitive pseudogroups.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1088/0951-7715/14/6/315","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-07-27T14:19:04.703Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"Z/HL2vMpTyiW3YqgNUslgA==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"610015d8d112b71809959a62"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"s1SybMnmTzOM0ws7cmU8BA==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"CLASSIFYING SPACES FOR GROUPOID STRUCTURES","authors":["T.

The most important groupoid is the groupoid Γq of germs of local diffeomorphisms of R. Then the classifying space BΓq classifies the foliations of codimension q. We review the groupoid of germs of local diffeomorphisms, construction of the classifying space for the groupoid, foliated microbundles, and some related notions. We state the Mather-Thurston isomorphism theorem: H∗(BDiffc(R );Z) ∼= H∗(ΩBΓ n;Z), and explain its meaning. We state the theory of existence of foliations by Gromov-PhillipsHaefliger-Thurston and give a list of known results on the topology of BΓq. The topology of BΓq turned out to depend on the regularity (differentiability). We also review the characterization by Segal-Haefliger of the classifying space for a groupoid structure. This is stated as follows: (X,F) BΓF if and only if the holonomy covering of any leaf is contractible. If we call such foliation typical, the Reeb foliation is typical. This gives rise a series of question. 1. Groupoid structures Let Diff(M) be the group of C∞ diffeomorphisms of a manifold M . Let ΓM denote the set of germs of elements of Diff(M). That is an element of ΓM is the equivalence class [f, x] of (f, x), where f ∈ Diff(M), x ∈ M , and (f0, x0) ∼ (f1, x1) if and only if x0 = x1 and there is a neighbourhood U of x0 such that f0|U = f1|U . There are well defined maps s (source) and t (target) : ΓM −→M defined by s([f, x]) = x and t([f, x]) = f(x). There is a map e in the other direction e : M −→ ΓM defined by e(x) = [id, x]. There is a topology on ΓM defined so that a basis of the neighborhoods of [f, x] is given by the set consisting of sets {[f, y]; y ∈ U} where (f, x) are representatives and U are neighborhoods of x. Then the maps s, t, e are continuous. Definition 1.1. A topological groupoid is a small topological category such that all morphisms are invertible. 1 Here “small category”means there are the set Obj of objects, the set Mor of morphisms, and maps s, t : Mor −→ Obj , e : Obj −→ Mor with appropriate properties. “Topological”means s, t, e, the composition and the inversion are continuous.

It is shown that the critical behavior of various susceptibilities exhibits finite-size scaling linear in the spatial volume quite accurately and that a cumulant taken as an indicator of the order of transition shows a behavior anticipated for a first-order transition. It is also found that the mass derived from the unsubtracted correlation function has a conspicuous volume dependence characteristic of a first-order phase transition. Furthermore, the physical mass gap representing a single particle excitation is shown to stay at a finite value at the transition point. We also demonstrate that the deconfining phase transition is controlled by the Z(3) property of Polyakov lines, their magnitude and phase fluctuations around the Z(3)-axes being unimportant, and that the effective Z(3) action possesses positive two-spin couplings which decrease exponentially with the distance between the two spins. All this evidence supports the first-order nature of the deconfining transition of the pure SU(3) gauge theory.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1016/0550-3213(90)90256-D","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-07-27T14:37:37.868Z"},"cited_articles":[]},{"_id":{"$oid":"61001a31d112b71809959a75"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"fipLMHXZRIirdnJXwKmx0Q==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"Calculation of thermodynamic properties of liquid argon from Lennard-Jones parameters by a Monte Carlo method","authors":["I.

An efficient way to estimate the microcanonical inverse temperature β ( E ) and the microcanonical entropy S ( E ) is achieved with the statistical temperature weighted histogram analysis method (ST-WHAM). The strength of this method lies on its flexibility, as it can be used to analyse data produced by algorithms with generalised sampling weights. However, for any sampling weight, ST-WHAM requires the calculation of derivatives of energy histograms H ( E ) , which leads to non-trivial and tedious binning tasks for models with continuous energy spectrum such as those for biomolecular and colloidal systems. Here, we discuss two alternative methods that avoid the need for such energy binning to obtain continuous estimates for H ( E ) in order to evaluate β ( E ) by using ST-WHAM: (i) a series expansion to estimate probability densities from the empirical cumulative distribution function (CDF), and (ii) a Bayesian approach to model this CDF.

Monte Carlo simulations and histogram reweighting techniques applied to multiple histograms are performed to identify the critical temperatures for the phase transitions taking place for stripes of width h = 2 on square lattices.

A common procedure consists in dropping the order of minimal contribution and the higher orders. This allows us to isolate very accurately the one-instanton effect for the double-well potential. For the one plaquette gauge theory, an exact analytical expression can be written for the non-perturbative part. We report recent attempts to extend this approach to the average plaquette of quenched QCD. Our goal is to express the non-perturbative effects in terms of expressions of the form beta^B exp(-A beta) calculable semi-classically. The situation is complicated by zeroes of the partition function in the complex $\\beta$ plane (presumably near 5.75 pm i 0.2). We discuss two methods to describe the intermediate and large order behavior of the perturbative series. One is inspired by mean field theory (logarithmic specific heat) and reproduces accurately the known perturbative series with only two free parameters. A diagrammatic interpretation of this fact is still lacking. The other is based on infra-red renormalons with a factorial growth showing up at order larger than 20 and a possible effective theory interpretation. These extrapolations are compatible with the non-perturbative part of the plaquette being proportional to a^4. We propose an exponential parametrization to the corrections to the universal part of the beta function and find results compatible with the suggestion of a^2 corrections made by C. Allton.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.22323/1.032.0215","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-07-27T14:38:01.008Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"ijZ5G2MCTVGtX60VY6NM9g==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"61001a49d112b71809959a9a"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"RpswCrBZSb6a2pGrC8TOnA==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"Lattice artefacts in SU(3) lattice gauge theory with a mixed fundamental and adjoint plaquette action","authors":["M.

An analysis based on an effective coupling formulation shows an apparent improvement.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1016/0370-2693(94)90167-8","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-07-27T14:38:21.006Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"ijZ5G2MCTVGtX60VY6NM9g==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"61001a5dd112b71809959aa9"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"QAAfv+dzT6Ofa/Botn80Qw==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"Phase structure of SU(2) lattice gauge theory with quantum gravity","authors":["B.

Chronological clustering of multidimensional count series detects the breakpoints; the shape of the text is revealed by applying correspondence analysis to the parts×words table while the progression of the argument is described by labelled time-constrained hierarchical clustering.

Much of it was documented in French, and it is often termed the French School. In general, the process consists of (1) coding data into a form conducive to the generation of a contingency table, (2) creation of a distance matrix based on a chi-square metric, (3) reduction of the dimensionality of the information in the distance matrix with the singular value decomposition (or other equivalent methods), (4) depicting the projected data graphically in a biplot-like presentation, and (5) performing hierarchical cluster analysis to provide alternate views of the data. Steps (2)–(4) are a form of multidimensional scaling, and are commonly referred to as correspondence analysis, but the book deals with all four steps, with plenty of emphasis on the coding and clustering steps. The author studied with Benzécri, and the book aims to be a summary of Benzécri’s work. Let us get one thing out of the way at the outset. Although the title might imply that there is material about R (1996) and Java per se, the reader will not learn much about programming in either language. R code listings throughout the book are used as the main vehicle to define the details of the procedures. This is very valuable. Readers familiar with R (or S) will have no difficulty reading the code, and will know exactly what the author is doing. The coding style is rudimentary, so readers need not be highly experienced in the R language to understand the code. Many of the procedures are also written in Java. Appropriately, the source code is not listed in the book—for a given amount of code, a lot more can be accomplished with R—but it is available (along with the R code, some C code, and selected datasets) on the author’s websites www.correspondences.info. There are six chapters, a preface and a forward. The forward by Jean–Paul Benzécri (in French and English) is interesting and entertaining, with reminiscences of the precomputer days, and the intellectual challenges faced by data analysts now that computational burden is no longer much of an issue. Chapter 1 (Introduction) starts with a lively, well-written history of data analysis, leading to Benzécri’s process of data analysis. Next, the ideas behind chi-square distance and correspondence analysis are explained and contrasted with principal components analysis. There is an introduction to data coding, where (among other things) continuous data can be transformed into a form suitable for correspondence analysis. Hierarchical cluster analysis is introduced as another view of the information in either the raw data, or its projections. The chapter ends with annotated listings of the R software. Chapter 2 (Theory of Correspondence Analysis) is claimed as being “not essential for reading later chapters,” and may be used as a reference as needed. This chapter is not light reading! It is highly mathematical. It is very well written mathematics, but it comes as a shock after reading an otherwise applied and practical book. Readers well grounded in real analysis and tensor calculus should do fine. Others may find it tough-going. The other bad news is that some key information is buried in this chapter, including multiple correspondence analysis, the Burt table, different methods of hierarchical cluster analysis, and importantly, notation used later on. Much of the material belongs in an appendix, and the rest should have been merged with the other chapters. Chapter 3 is dedicated to data coding, where numerous (some very clever) methods are used to transform and weight raw data to put it into a form suitable for correspondence analysis. The methods of doubling, complete disjunctive coding, fuzzy coding, and additional methods are defined and illustrated. The presentation is excellent. It gives plenty of motivation to think hard about the objectives of the analysis, and whether the form of the raw data fulfills these objectives. A skeptic might think that the coding methods are intended to allow virtually any data to be analyzed via correspondence analysis, but the author convincingly shows the value of at least considering data coding, whether one uses correspondence analysis or not. Also, I can see the possibility of these tools used by trial and error until the researcher sees the answer they seek. Moreover, discretizing continuous data that may already be in a form perfect for analysis (e.g., by principal components) may be both unnecessary and misleading: if the aim is to infer something about a continuous distribution, discretization can badly distort the picture. To avoid these pitfalls, the reader needs to understand the guidance given in the beginning pages of this chapter. Chapter 4 is dedicated to examples. Several comprise size and shape data, and the rest are financial and economic examples. Each one is thoroughly explained, and the software used to do the coding and analysis is presented. The general theme in these examples is the discovery of structure in the data. Using the powerful methods described in the book, detailed structure is found and described. It is very interesting reading, but I was left wondering how much of this structure is due to the manner in which the data was collected and not fundamental population properties. (A statistician should ask this question.) The last chapter, a long one, is dedicated to text analysis, where files of text form are parsed into a form suitable for correspondence analysis (e.g., contingency tables of counts of certain types of words versus literary works). The introductory material in this chapter gives enough background and terminology for readers unfamiliar with this kind of application to at least superficially understand the rest of the chapter. However, those unfamiliar with this application area, like myself, will find much of the material ponderously detailed and difficult to grasp at a deeper level. This is particularly true with most of the first half of the chapter, where a review of applications, primarily by Benzécri, is given without showing any exemplifying data. Luckily, the chapter ends with several detailed, and very interesting, case studies. (How can one resist an application entitled Eight Hypotheses of Parmenides Regarding the One?) It is obligatory to ask if this book will appeal to statistical practitioners in the engineering and physical sciences. For those who routinely apply multivariate techniques, and are curious about the “French School” of data analysis, it is worth reading, despite its flaws here and there. It gives a convincing argument in favor of carefully thinking about the form the data should assume (i.e., data coding) prior to the use of any multivariate technique. It describes applications that are “outside the box” for engineering and the physical science purposes, but that is a good thing: many methods used today were not originally applied to engineering and physical science data. It has considerable material of a historical and philosophical nature, and that is also a good thing. Be forewarned the writing is often packed with many details, and it is a little uneven in style. Readers wanting “just the facts” about correspondence analysis may be more satisfied with chapter 10 of Jackson (1991), or Greenacre (1993).","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1198/tech.2007.s449","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-07-27T17:58:09.489Z"},"cited_articles":[]},{"_id":{"$oid":"61004931d112b71809959ab9"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"AxPrczvYQ9KPLN0pcHJ2wg==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"L'analyse des données","authors":["P.

The following two principles for analysis of emotion inform our work. Firstly, emotion is revealed not as a quality in its own right but rather through interaction. We study the 2-way relationship of Ilsa and Rick in the movie Casablanca, and the 3-way relationship of Emma, Charles and Rodolphe in the novel {\\em Madame Bovary}. Secondly, emotion, that is expression of states of mind of subjects, is formed and evolves within the narrative that expresses external events and (personal, social, physical) context. In addition to the analysis methodology with key aspects that are innovative, the input data used is crucial. We use, firstly, dialogue, and secondly, broad and general description that incorporates dialogue. In a follow-on study, we apply our unsupervised narrative mapping to data streams with very low emotional expression. We map the narrative of Twitter streams. Thus we demonstrate map analysis of general narratives.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.46298/jdmdh.647","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-07-27T17:58:09.694Z"},"cited_articles":[]},{"_id":{"$oid":"61004932d112b71809959abb"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"Ga8R5JUBTaSsxrI3Z40piQ==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"Exploratory multivariate analysis by example using R","authors":["E.

Interestingly though, in their book the authors classify (simple) correspondence analysis and multiple correspondence analysis (which essentially lie on the same branch of the correspondence analysis family tree) as two separate analyses. Thus, the book comprises of four chapters (for each of the four techniques considered) where each methodology is treated with an applied (not mathematical) analyst in mind; Chapter 1 looks at principal component analysis, Chapter 2 examines (simple) correspondence analysis while its multiple cousin is described in Chapter 3. Chapter 4 includes a treatment of hierarchical cluster analysis. Each chapter includes an overview of the key mathematical concepts which are described with an appropriate level of simplicity without resorting to the same technical rigour that other books consider. They also include a comprehensive treatment of the concepts and applications that typically are seen in many books and articles on the subject. Despite the relative scarcity of topics considered in this book, the contents page and index are helpful and reflect the comprehensive nature in which each of the four topics is covered. A key focus of the book is to demonstrate the application of their R package, FactomineR, which two of the authors wrote on in 2008 [1]. There is a clear exposition of the use of the code throughout and it is clear that the book is used as a vehicle to help promote this package. An appendix is included and largely consists of an overview of FactomineR. Interestingly, unlike many books on multivariate data analysis (even those aimed at a fairly elementary level) this book does not express the mathematical concepts in matrix form. This is clearly advantageous for those who are considering the book from an applied perspective. This, I think, is refreshing and is done well. The authors state in their preface (page xii) that the book is ‘...addressed to practitioners who are confronted with the analysis of data’where the ‘examples and intuition have been emphasised’. They have successfully achieved both of these aims and I therefore recommend the book to those who are interested in an introduction to these multivariate techniques. For those who wish to gain a deeper understanding of the topics, you will not find it here, but the book does provide a solid starting point for those who are just starting out. In fairness to the authors, in their short bibliography, they do point to other very useful texts where such insights may be gained. It is definitely a book to have in ones institutional/organisational, or even private, library.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1080/02664763.2012.657409","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-07-27T17:58:10.780Z"},"cited_articles":[]},{"_id":{"$oid":"61014bd6d112b71809959abc"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"bZVftihtTxycA2XO0fxS5g==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"Incremental

In this work we study the problem of learning when the distribution that generate the examples changes over time. We present a method for detection of changes in the probability distribution of examples. The idea behind the drift detection method is to control the online error-rate of the algorithm. The training examples are presented in sequence. When a new training example is available, it is classified using the actual model. Statistical theory guarantees that while the distribution is stationary, the error will decrease. When the distribution changes, the error will increase. The method controls the trace of the online error of the algorithm. For the actual context we define a warning level, and a drift level. A new context is declared, if in a sequence of examples, the error increases reaching the warning level at example k w , and the drift level at example k d . This is an indication of a change in the distribution of the examples. The algorithm learns a new model using only the examples since k w . The method was tested with a set of eight artificial datasets and a real world dataset. We used three learning algorithms: a perceptron, a neural network and a decision tree. The experimental results show a good performance detecting drift and with learning the new concept. We also observe that the method is independent of the learning algorithm.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1007/978-3-540-28645-5_29","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-07-28T12:22:06.153Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"bZVftihtTxycA2XO0fxS5g==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"2Scd+RmIR7uDL+tTbzswZw==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"61014beed112b71809959abe"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"29Q5Xe88R7y7P1PY7p4QRQ==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"Solving large scale linear prediction problems using stochastic gradient descent algorithms","authors":["Tong Zhang"],"date":{"$date":"2004-07-28T00:00:00.000Z"},"pdf_url":"http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1015332","abstract":"Linear prediction methods, such as least squares for regression, logistic regression and support vector machines for classification, have been extensively used in statistics and machine learning.

The proposed system, VFDTc, can incorporate and classify new information online, with a single scan of the data, in time constant per example. The most relevant property of our system is the ability to obtain a performance similar to a standard decision tree algorithm even for medium size datasets.

The ensemble members are combined through a dynamically weighted majority voting, where voting weights are determined based on classifiers' age-adjusted accuracy on current and past environments. Unlike other ensemble-based concept drift algorithms, Learn++.NSE does not discard prior classifiers, allowing potentially cyclical environments to be learned more effectively. While Learn++.NSE has been shown to work well on a variety of concept drift problems, a potential shortcoming of this approach is the cumulative nature of the ensemble size. In this contribution, we expand our analysis of the algorithm to include various ensemble pruning methods to introduce controlled forgetting. Error or age-based pruning methods have been integrated into the algorithm to prevent potential out-voting from irrelevant classifiers or simply to save memory over an extended period of time.

A key property of our approach is that it minimizes the time required to build a model on a stream while guaranteeing (as long as the data are iid) that the model learned is effectively indistinguishable from the one that would be obtained using infinite data. Using this framework, we have successfully adapted several learning algorithms to massive data streams, including decision tree induction, Bayesian network learning, k-means clustering, and the EM algorithm for mixtures of Gaussians.

Accordingly, it is desirable to be able to abandon the traditional assumption of the availability of representative training data during the training period to develop decision boundaries. Under scenarios of continuous data flow, the challenge is how to transform the vast amount of stream raw data into information and knowledge representation, and accumulate experience over time to support future decision-making process. In this paper, we propose a general adaptive incremental learning framework named ADAIN that is capable of learning from continuous raw data, accumulating experience over time, and using such knowledge to improve future learning and prediction performance.

The proposed algorithm, named Learn++.NSE, learns from consecutive batches of data without making any assumptions on the nature or rate of drift; it can learn from such environments that experience constant or variable rate of drift, addition or deletion of concept classes, as well as cyclical drift. The algorithm learns incrementally, as other members of the Learn++ family of algorithms, that is, without requiring access to previously seen data. Learn++.NSE trains one new classifier for each batch of data it receives, and combines these classifiers using a dynamically weighted majority voting. The novelty of the approach is in determining the voting weights, based on each classifier's time-adjusted accuracy on current and past environments. This approach allows the algorithm to recognize, and act accordingly, to the changes in underlying data distributions, as well as to a possible reoccurrence of an earlier distribution. We evaluate the algorithm on several synthetic datasets designed to simulate a variety of nonstationary environments, as well as a real-world weather prediction dataset. Comparisons with several other approaches are also included. Results indicate that Learn++.NSE can track the changing environments very closely, regardless of the type of concept drift.

Most of them are targeted to work under the system linearity assumption, but also some have been proposed to deal with the nonlinear case study. In particular the authors have recently advanced a neural architecture, namely time-varying neural networks (TV-NN), which has shown remarkable identification properties in the presence of nonlinear and nonstationary conditions. TV-NN training is an issue due to the high number of free parameters and the extreme learning machine (ELM) approach has been successfully used on purpose. ELM is a fast learning algorithm that has recently caught much attention within the neural networks (NNs) research community. Many variants of ELM have been appeared in recent literature, specially for the stationary case study. The reference one for TV-NN training is named ELM-TV and is of batch-learning type. In this contribution an online sequential version of ELM-TV is developed, in response to the need of dealing with applications where sequential arrival or large number of training data occurs. This algorithm generalizes the corresponding counterpart working under stationary conditions. Its performances have been evaluated in some nonstationary and nonlinear system identification tasks and related results show that the advanced technique produces comparable generalization performances to ELM-TV, ensuring at the same time all benefits of an online sequential approach.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1016/j.neucom.2011.12.064","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-07-28T12:22:29.435Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"bZVftihtTxycA2XO0fxS5g==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"61014c05d112b71809959ae1"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"2Scd+RmIR7uDL+tTbzswZw==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"Batch-Incremental versus Instance-Incremental Learning in Dynamic and Evolving Data","authors":["Jesse Read","A.

However, the features extracted may in part be due to irrelevant scene context, or movements shared amongst multiple action classes. This motivates learning with local discriminative parts, which can help localise which parts of the video are significant. Exploiting spatio-temporal structure in the video should also improve results, just as deformable part models have proven highly successful in object recognition. However, whereas objects have clear boundaries which means we can easily define a ground truth for initialisation, 3D space–time actions are inherently ambiguous and expensive to annotate in large datasets. Thus, it is desirable to adapt pictorial star models to action datasets without location annotation, and to features invariant to changes in pose such as bag-of-feature and Fisher vectors, rather than low-level HoG. Thus, we propose local deformable spatial bag-of-features in which local discriminative regions are split into a fixed grid of parts that are allowed to deform in both space and time at test-time. In our experimental evaluation we demonstrate that by using local space–time action parts in a weakly supervised setting, we are able to achieve state-of-the-art classification performance, whilst being able to localise actions even in the most challenging video datasets.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1007/s11263-013-0662-8","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-07-28T12:22:30.198Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"bZVftihtTxycA2XO0fxS5g==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"61014c06d112b71809959ae3"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"1PkvLLXaSfCN+mY2cx7Xww==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"Efficient data stream classification via probabilistic adaptive windows","authors":["A.

Concept drift is further complicated if the data set is class imbalanced. While these two issues have been independently addressed, their joint treatment has been mostly underexplored. We describe two ensemble-based approaches for learning concept drift from imbalanced data. Our first approach is a logical combination of our previously introduced Learn++.NSE algorithm for concept drift, with the well-established SMOTE for learning from imbalanced data. Our second approach makes two major modifications to Learn++.NSE-SMOTE integration by replacing SMOTE with a subensemble that makes strategic use of minority class data; and replacing Learn++.NSE and its class-independent error weighting mechanism with a penalty constraint that forces the algorithm to balance accuracy on all classes. The primary novelty of this approach is in determining the voting weights for combining ensemble members, based on each classifier's time and imbalance-adjusted accuracy on current and past environments. Favorable results in comparison to other approaches indicate that both approaches are able to address this challenging problem, each with its own specific areas of strength. We also release all experimental data as a resource and benchmark for future research.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1109/TKDE.2012.136","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-07-28T12:22:30.915Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"bZVftihtTxycA2XO0fxS5g==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"61014c07d112b71809959ae7"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"rqFPOv9SRKuiQb50CBOFvQ==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"A Survey of Stream Classification Algorithms","authors":["C.

In the dynamic target graph, nodes are the target local parts encoding appearance information, and edges are the interactions between nodes encoding inner geometric structure information. This graph representation provides much more information for tracking in the presence of deformation and occlusion. The target tracking is then formulated as tracking this dynamic undirected graph, which is also a matching problem between the target graph and the candidate graph. The local parts within the candidate graph are separated from the background with Markov random field, and spectral clustering is used to solve the graph matching. The final target state is determined through a weighted voting procedure according to the reliability of part correspondence, and refined with recourse to a foreground/background segmentation. An effective online updating mechanism is proposed to update the model, allowing DGT to robustly adapt to variations of target structure.

In this study, we proposed a new method for the prediction of the DNA-binding proteins, by performing the feature rank using random forest and the wrapper-based feature selection using forward best-first search strategy. The features comprise information from primary sequence, predicted secondary structure, predicted relative solvent accessibility, and position specific scoring matrix. The proposed method, called DBPPred, used Gaussian naïve Bayes as the underlying classifier since it outperformed five other classifiers, including decision tree, logistic regression, k-nearest neighbor, support vector machine with polynomial kernel, and support vector machine with radial basis function. As a result, the proposed DBPPred yields the highest average accuracy of 0.791 and average MCC of 0.583 according to the five-fold cross validation with ten runs on the training benchmark dataset PDB594. Subsequently, blind tests on the independent dataset PDB186 by the proposed model trained on the entire PDB594 dataset and by other five existing methods (including iDNA-Prot, DNA-Prot, DNAbinder, DNABIND and DBD-Threader) were performed, resulting in that the proposed DBPPred yielded the highest accuracy of 0.769, MCC of 0.538, and AUC of 0.790. The independent tests performed by the proposed DBPPred on completely a large non-DNA binding protein dataset and two RNA binding protein datasets also showed improved or comparable quality when compared with the relevant prediction methods. Moreover, we observed that majority of the selected features by the proposed method are statistically significantly different between the mean feature values of the DNA-binding and the non DNA-binding proteins. All of the experimental results indicate that the proposed DBPPred can be an alternative perspective predictor for large-scale determination of DNA-binding proteins.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1371/journal.pone.0086703","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-07-28T12:22:32.308Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"bZVftihtTxycA2XO0fxS5g==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"61014c08d112b71809959aed"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"14R3ajxrRt2WTbej40HQDQ==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"Security Evaluation of Support Vector Machines in Adversarial Environments","authors":["B.

We propose a pattern recognition system with an incremental learning ensemble algorithm using support vector machines (SVM) tackling this problem employing multimodal MR images and a texture-based information strategy. The proposed system integrates anatomic, texture, and functional features. The data set was preprocessed using B-Spline interpolation, bias field correction and intensity standardization. First- and second-order angular independent statistical approaches and rotation invariant local phase quantization (RI-LPQ) were utilized to quantify texture information. An incremental learning ensemble SVM was implemented to suit working conditions in medical applications and to improve effectiveness and robustness of the system. The probability estimation of cancer structures was calculated using SVM and the corresponding optimization was carried out with a heuristic method together with a 3-fold cross-validation methodology. We achieved an average sensitivity of 0.844±0.068 and a specificity of 0.780±0.038, which yielded superior or similar performance to current state of the art using a total database of only 41 slices from twelve patients with histological confirmed information, including cancerous, unhealthy non-cancerous and healthy prostate tissue. Our results show the feasibility of an ensemble SVM being able to learn additional information from new data while preserving previously acquired knowledge and preventing unlearning. The use of texture descriptors provides more salient discriminative patterns than the functional information used. Furthermore, the system improves selection of information, efficiency and robustness of the classification.

Optical images stand out from other remote sensing images in object detection due to their higher resolution and more visualized contents. However, most of the popular techniques for ship detection from optical spaceborne images have two shortcomings: 1) Compared with infrared and synthetic aperture radar images, their results are affected by weather conditions, like clouds and ocean waves, and 2) the higher resolution results in larger data volume, which makes processing more difficult. Most of the previous works mainly focus on solving the first problem by improving segmentation or classification with complicated algorithms. These methods face difficulty in efficiently balancing performance and complexity. In this paper, we propose a ship detection approach to solving the aforementioned two issues using wavelet coefficients extracted from JPEG2000 compressed domain combined with deep neural network (DNN) and extreme learning machine (ELM). Compressed domain is adopted for fast ship candidate extraction, DNN is exploited for high-level feature representation and classification, and ELM is used for efficient feature pooling and decision making. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, in comparison with the existing relevant state-of-the-art approaches, the proposed method requires less detection time and achieves higher detection accuracy.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2014.2335751","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-07-28T12:22:33.531Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"bZVftihtTxycA2XO0fxS5g==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"61014c09d112b71809959af3"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"gAQiY+n/TMqxp1mGcFsIaA==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"Hyperopt: a Python library for model selection and hyperparameter optimization","authors":["J.

This efficiency makes it appropriate for optimizing the hyperparameters of machine learning algorithms that are slow to train. The Hyperopt library provides algorithms and parallelization infrastructure for performing hyperparameter optimization (model selection) in Python. This paper presents an introductory tutorial on the usage of the Hyperopt library, including the description of search spaces, minimization (in serial and parallel), and the analysis of the results collected in the course of minimization. This paper also gives an overview of Hyperopt-Sklearn, a software project that provides automatic algorithm configuration of the Scikit-learn machine learning library. Following Auto-Weka, we take the view that the choice of classifier and even the choice of preprocessing module can be taken together to represent a single large hyperparameter optimization problem. We use Hyperopt to define a search space that encompasses many standard components (e.g. SVM, RF, KNN, PCA, TFIDF) and common patterns of composing them together. We demonstrate, using search algorithms in Hyperopt and standard benchmarking data sets (MNIST, 20-newsgroups, convex shapes), that searching this space is practical and effective. In particular, we improve on best-known scores for the model space for both MNIST and convex shapes.

Often, it is assumed - either implicitly or explicitly - that the process generating such a stream of data is stationary, that is, the data are drawn from a fixed, albeit unknown probability distribution. In many real-world scenarios, however, such an assumption is simply not true, and the underlying process generating the data stream is characterized by an intrinsic nonstationary (or evolving or drifting) phenomenon. The nonstationarity can be due, for example, to seasonality or periodicity effects, changes in the users' habits or preferences, hardware or software faults affecting a cyber-physical system, thermal drifts or aging effects in sensors. In such nonstationary environments, where the probabilistic properties of the data change over time, a non-adaptive model trained under the false stationarity assumption is bound to become obsolete in time, and perform sub-optimally at best, or fail catastrophically at worst.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1109/MCI.2015.2471196","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-07-28T12:22:33.805Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"bZVftihtTxycA2XO0fxS5g==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"61014c0ad112b71809959af5"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"fWelZ0V5SPuPjYFD4/m9vg==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"Partially-supervised learning from facial trajectories for face recognition in video surveillance","authors":["Miguel De-la-Torre","Éric Granger","P.

To enroll target individuals, it is often costly or unfeasible to capture enough high quality reference facial samples a priori to design representative facial models. Furthermore, changes in capture conditions and physiology contribute to a growing divergence between these models and faces captured during operations. Adaptive biometrics seek to maintain a high level of performance by updating facial models over time using operational data. Adaptive multiple classifier systems (MCSs) have been successfully applied to video-to-video FR, where the face of each target individual is modeled using an ensemble of 2-class classifiers (trained using target vs. non-target samples). In this paper, a new adaptive MCS is proposed for partially-supervised learning of facial models over time based on facial trajectories. During operations, information from a face tracker and individual-specific ensembles is integrated for robust spatio-temporal recognition and for self-update of facial models. The tracker defines a facial trajectory for each individual that appears in a video, which leads to the recognition of a target individual if the positive predictions accumulated along a trajectory surpass a detection threshold for an ensemble. When the number of positive ensemble predictions surpasses a higher update threshold, then all target face samples from the trajectory are combined with non-target samples (selected from the cohort and universal models) to update the corresponding facial model. A learn-and-combine strategy is employed to avoid knowledge corruption during self-update of ensembles. In addition, a memory management strategy based on Kullback-Leibler divergence is proposed to rank and select the most relevant target and non-target reference samples to be stored in memory as the ensembles evolves. For proof-of-concept, a particular realization of the proposed system was validated with videos from Face in Action dataset. Initially, trajectories captured from enrollment videos are used for supervised learning of ensembles, and then videos from various operational sessions are presented to the system for FR and self-update with high-confidence trajectories. At a transaction level, the proposed approach outperforms baseline systems that do not adapt to new trajectories, and provides comparable performance to ideal systems that adapt to all relevant target trajectories, through supervised learning. Subject-level analysis reveals the existence of individuals for which self-updating ensembles with unlabeled facial trajectories provides a considerable benefit. Trajectory-level analysis indicates that the proposed system allows for robust spatio-temporal video-to-video FR, and may therefore enhance security and situation analysis in video surveillance.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1016/j.inffus.2014.05.006","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-07-28T12:22:34.933Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"bZVftihtTxycA2XO0fxS5g==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"61014c0bd112b71809959af6"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"3yu/2xnQTT2hD8UA1uSaYA==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"Interactive online learning for obstacle classification on a mobile robot","authors":["Viktor Losing","B.

Historically, this required interpretation of natural phenomena by priests, magicians or ‘wise women’. Some of these universally known ‘signs’, which were said to be predictions of the future (and considered bad omens today), were of such a general nature that they were difficult to apply to daily life, for instance sightings of black cats that foretold bad luck. Many legends and ancient mythologies recount attempts to deal with such portents. For instance, the Persian tale, where a gardener’s encounter with Death causes him to flee to Isfahan but Death is actually on the way there, to collect the gardener so is surprised to see him before his hour. Other stories tell of individuals who had strong foresight but, like Cassandra of Troy, were never believed. The Romans approached the matter in a logical fashion and asked only yes or no questions of their augurs, who were able to indicate whether a certain day was favorable to go to battle by looking at the entrails of a freshly slaughtered animal. In modern science, which may itself be defined as predicting future events from observing past occurrences, some areas are more successful than others. Simple Newtonian laws suffice to accurately predict the time it takes an apple to fall from a tree to the ground, or the braking distance of a car of a certain weight going a certain speed, while economics may boast spectacular failures, without any stock exchange crash or economic crisis having been predicted. Modern medicine resides somewhere between bad omens and Roman augurs, while those involved in public health may sometimes feel akin to Cassandra when they witness a new generation taking up smoking. Genetic research has brought us many omens: a variant may be bad luck, but it is unknown if and whether it will have an effect, and there is nothing one can do about it. Prediction models are the result of sophisticated mathematical models designed to answer the yes or no question as to who will develop, or already has, a disease. Over the years, the number of publications in medicine with such prediction scores has risen dramatically, as Fig. 1 shows. The Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis has also published a number of articles with prediction scores. In this October issue, the VISION investigators report on prediction of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation undergoing surgery: a clinically relevant dilemma, for nearly 5% died or suffered a stroke in the 30 days following surgery. There were differences in the predictive power of the four scoring tools that were compared, which is useful knowledge. The question that remains, and that has echoes from antiquity, is whether it is useful to predict. This will only be the case when we have methods to protect those at increased risk, or if we can avoid certain surgeries. A more philosophical question is whether there is a theoretical maximum in prediction. As we cannot monitor people on a daily basis, supposing we even knew what aspects to monitor, there will always remain apparently random events that are unpredictable, yet at the heart of the matter, there still may be some principle to this randomness.

Understanding what the user is doing in the environment is important for adapting the environment's behavior, as well as for identifying situations that could be problematic for the user. Enabling the environment to exploit models of the user's most common behaviors is an important step toward this objective. In particular, models of the daily routines of a user can be exploited not only for predicting his/her needs, but also for comparing the actual situation at a given moment with the expected one, in order to detect anomalies in his/her behavior. While manually setting up process models in business and factory environments may be cost-effective, building models of the processes involved in people's everyday life is infeasible. This fact fully justifies the interest of the Ambient Intelligence community in automatically learning such models from examples of actual behavior. Incremental adaptation of the models and the ability to express/learn complex conditions on the involved tasks are also desirable. This article describes how process mining can be used for learning users’ daily routines from a dataset of annotated sensor data. The solution that we propose relies on a First-Order Logic learning approach. Indeed, First-Order Logic provides a single, comprehensive and powerful framework for supporting all the previously mentioned features. Our experiments, performed both on a proprietary toy dataset and on publicly available real-world ones, indicate that this approach is efficient and effective for learning and modeling daily routines in Smart Home Environments.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1145/2675063","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-07-28T12:22:35.837Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"bZVftihtTxycA2XO0fxS5g==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"61014c1ad112b71809959af9"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"HBXlgWxCR+ujvL2WkwOupw==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"Extreme Learning Machine for Multilayer Perceptron","authors":["Jiexiong Tang","Chenwei Deng","Guangbin Huang"],"date":{"$date":"2016-07-28T00:00:00.000Z"},"pdf_url":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7103337","abstract":"Extreme learning machine (ELM) is an emerging learning algorithm for the generalized single hidden layer feedforward neural networks, of which the hidden node parameters are randomly generated and the output weights are analytically computed. However, due to its shallow architecture, feature learning using ELM may not be effective for natural signals (e.g., images/videos), even with a large number of hidden nodes. To address this issue, in this paper, a new ELM-based hierarchical learning framework is proposed for multilayer perceptron. The proposed architecture is divided into two main components: 1) self-taught feature extraction followed by supervised feature classification and 2) they are bridged by random initialized hidden weights. The novelties of this paper are as follows: 1) unsupervised multilayer encoding is conducted for feature extraction, and an ELM-based sparse autoencoder is developed via ℓ1 constraint. By doing so, it achieves more compact and meaningful feature representations than the original ELM; 2) by exploiting the advantages of ELM random feature mapping, the hierarchically encoded outputs are randomly projected before final decision making, which leads to a better generalization with faster learning speed; and 3) unlike the greedy layerwise training of deep learning (DL), the hidden layers of the proposed framework are trained in a forward manner. Once the previous layer is established, the weights of the current layer are fixed without fine-tuning. Therefore, it has much better learning efficiency than the DL. Extensive experiments on various widely used classification data sets show that the proposed algorithm achieves better and faster convergence than the existing state-of-the-art hierarchical learning methods. Furthermore, multiple applications in computer vision further confirm the generality and capability of the proposed learning scheme.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1109/TNNLS.2015.2424995","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-07-28T12:22:50.198Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"bZVftihtTxycA2XO0fxS5g==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"61014c1ad112b71809959afa"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"Ae4M8hLRRXazbAp3wENOaw==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"Voxel-based Gaussian naïve Bayes classification of ischemic stroke lesions in individual T1-weighted MRI scans","authors":["J.

It can be easilyapplied in practice since an optimization of the meta parameters is not necessary. The basic idea is to construct dedicated models for thecurrent and former concepts and apply them according tothe demands of the given situation. An extensive evaluation on various benchmarks, consisting of artificial streamswith known drift characteristics as well as real world datasets is conducted.

Processing such fast streams often demands high memory and processing resources. In addition, they can be affected by non-stationary phenomena (concept drift), by which learning methods have to detect changes in the distribution of streaming data, and adapt to these evolving conditions. A lack of efficient and scalable solutions is particularly noted in real-time scenarios where computing resources are severely constrained, as it occurs in networks of small, numerous, interconnected processing units (such as the so-called Smart Dust, Utility Fog, or Swarm Robotics paradigms).

Accordingly, efficient and accurate traffic flow prediction has become a research hot spot in the field of intelligent transportation. However, traditional machine learning algorithms cannot further optimize the model with the increase of the data scale, and the deep learning algorithms perform poorly in mobile application or real-time application; how to train and update deep learning models efficiently and accurately is still an urgent problem since they require huge computation resources and time costs. ,erefore, an incremental learning-based CNN-LTSM model, IL-TFNet, is proposed for traffic flow prediction in this study. ,e lightweight convolution neural network-based model architecture is designed to process spatiotemporal and external environment features simultaneously to improve the prediction performance and prediction efficiency of the model. Especially, the K-means clustering algorithm is applied as an uncertainty feature to extract unknown traffic accident information. During the model training, instead of the traditional batch learning algorithm, the incremental learning algorithm is applied to reduce the cost of updating the model and satisfy the requirements of high real-time performance and low computational overhead in short-term traffic prediction. Furthermore, the idea of combining incremental learning with active learning is proposed to fine-tune the prediction model to improve prediction accuracy in special situations.

Several automatic classification approaches have been proposed in different computer science areas in order to complement the exhaustive human task of manually labeling volcano-seismic events. However, most of these approaches have been designed under the assumption of stationarity; that is, by discarding the changing nature of the volcanic phenomenon that evolves over time. In this work, an adaptive classification strategy based on incremental learning is proposed, which identifies and learns concept drifts of data streams coming from seismic recordings. The proposed strategy uses a classifier ensemble in order to handle recurrent states and classifies data even while true labels are not yet available. Unlike usual experimental protocols in the state–of–the–art, we carried out experiments with seismic data from Villarrica volcano, considering the chronological order of the data during a long period (more than 4 years of registration) to achieve the detection of drifts. The results show that the proposed classification strategy satisfactorily counteracts the changes, in contrast to standard classifiers trained within a traditional learning scheme. The proposed strategy keeps a stable classification accuracy and achieves a reduction of up to 0.28 of the absolute error in episodes of abrupt changes.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1016/J.JVOLGEORES.2021.107211","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-07-28T12:22:53.199Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"bZVftihtTxycA2XO0fxS5g==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"61014c1dd112b71809959b05"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"XG7LHhoISP2jnqzD0PInSw==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"Concept-Cognitive Learning Model for Incremental Concept Learning","authors":["Yong Shi","Yunlong Mi","Jinhai Li","Wenqi Liu"],"date":{"$date":"2021-07-28T00:00:00.000Z"},"pdf_url":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8574051","abstract":"Concept-cognitive learning (CCL) is an emerging field of concerning incremental concept learning and dynamic knowledge processing in the context of dynamic environments. Although CCL has been widely researched in theory, the existing studies of CCL have one problem: the concepts obtained by CCL systems do not have generalization ability. In the meantime, the existing incremental algorithms still face some challenges that: 1) classifiers have to adapt gradually and 2) the previously acquired knowledge should be efficiently utilized. To address these problems, based on the advantage that CCL can naturally integrate new data into itself for enhancing flexibility of concept learning, we first propose a new CCL model (CCLM) to extend the classical methods of CCL, which is not only a new classifier but also good at incremental learning. Unlike the existing CCL systems, the theory of CCLM is mainly based on a formal decision context rather than a formal context. In learning concepts from dynamic environments, we show that CCLM can naturally incorporate new data into itself with a sufficient theoretical guarantee for incremental learning. For classification task and knowledge storage, our results on various data sets demonstrate that CCLM can simultaneously: 1) achieve the state-of-the-art static and dynamic classification task and 2) directly accomplish preservation of previously acquired knowledge (or concepts) under dynamic environments.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1109/TSMC.2018.2882090","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-07-28T12:22:53.525Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"bZVftihtTxycA2XO0fxS5g==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"61014c1ed112b71809959b06"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"1em9QVBiTvCZrHh8wBqmuA==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"Connected Vehicle Based Distributed Meta-Learning for Online Adaptive Engine/Powertrain Fuel Consumption Modeling","authors":["Xin Ma","M.

Properties of the target task are considered to be non-stationary due to drift processes while the training is performed. Different types of concept drift are studied, which affect the density of example inputs only, the target rule itself, or both. By applying methods from statistical physics, we develop a modelling framework for the mathematical analysis of the training dynamics in non-stationary environments.

Specially in these non-stationary scenarios, there is a pressing need for new algorithms that adapt to these changes as fast as possible, while maintaining good performance scores. Unfortunately, most off-the-shelf classification models need to be retrained if they are used in changing environments, and fail to scale properly.

The presented multi-core HW/SW architecture achieves a peak performance of 2.21 and 1.70 MAC/cycle, respectively, when running forward and backward steps of the gradient descent. We report the trade-off between memory footprint, latency, and accuracy for learning a new class with Latent Replay CL when targeting an image classification task on the CORe50 dataset. For a CL setting that retrains all the layers, taking 5h to learn a new class and achieving up to 77.3% of precision, a more efficient solution retrains only part of the network, reaching an accuracy of 72.5% with a memory requirement of 300 MB and a computation latency of 1.5 hours. On the other side, retraining only the last layer results in the fastest (867 ms) and less memory hungry (20 MB) solution but scoring 58% on the CORe50 dataset. Thanks to the parallelism of the low-power cluster engine, our HW/SW platform results 25× faster than typical MCU device, on which CL is still impractical, and demonstrates an 11× gain in terms of energy consumption with respect to mobile-class solutions.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1109/SiPS50750.2020.9195220","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-07-28T12:22:55.353Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"bZVftihtTxycA2XO0fxS5g==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"61014c1fd112b71809959b0f"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"4HEuZS4qRSi7ouDjy1IbLg==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"Exploiting the stimuli encoding scheme of evolving Spiking Neural Networks for stream learning","authors":["Jesus L.

Unfortunately, traditional machine learning algorithms are not prepared to tackle the specific challenges imposed by data stream processing, such as the need for learning incrementally, limited memory and processing time requirements, and adaptation to non-stationary data, among others. To face these paradigms, Spiking Neural Networks have emerged as one of the most promising stream learning techniques, with variants such as Evolving Spiking Neural Networks capable of efficiently addressing many of these challenges. Interestingly, these networks resort to a particular population encoding scheme - Gaussian Receptive Fields - to transform the incoming stimuli into temporal spikes. The study presented in this manuscript sheds light on the predictive potential of this encoding scheme, focusing on how it can be applied as a computationally lightweight, model-agnostic preprocessing step for data stream learning. We provide informed intuition to unveil under which circumstances the aforementioned population encoding method yields effective prediction gains in data stream classification with respect to the case where no preprocessing is performed. Results obtained for a variety of stream learning models and both synthetic and real stream datasets are discussed to empirically buttress the capability of Gaussian Receptive Fields to boost the predictive performance of stream learning methods, spanning further research towards extrapolating our findings to other machine learning problems.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1016/j.neunet.2019.11.021","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-07-28T12:22:55.468Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"bZVftihtTxycA2XO0fxS5g==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"61014c20d112b71809959b10"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"xo2Y1oPOSRqCYZyehv2paw==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"Prevention of catastrophic interference and imposing active forgetting with generative methods","authors":["Sergey V.

We developed and tested several methods for preventing CI using an artificial dataset generated on the base of previous experience of neural network. The proposed methods include the activation maximization approach, the method based on Bayesian learning, and the method based on generative neural networks. The methods based on a combination of episodic memory (several stored samples) and semantic memory (sampling of posterior probability function) show superiority compared to other recent methods devoted to CI prevention.

This rapid growth has fueled incredible transformations over the past decade. Nowadays, there exist insurance products for most high-value assets such as vehicles, jewellery, health/life, and homes. Insurance companies are at the forefront in adopting cutting-edge operations, processes, and mathematical models to maximize profit whilst servicing their customers claims. Traditional methods that are exclusively based on human-in-the-loop models are very time-consuming and inaccurate. In this paper, we develop a secure and automated insurance system framework that reduces human interaction, secures the insurance activities, alerts and informs about risky customers, detects fraudulent claims, and reduces monetary loss for the insurance sector. After presenting the blockchain-based framework to enable secure transactions and data sharing among different interacting agents within the insurance network, we propose to employ the extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) machine learning algorithm for the aforementioned insurance services and compare its performances with those of other state-of-the-art algorithms. The obtained results reveal that, when applied to an auto insurance dataset, the XGboost achieves high performance gains compared to other existing learning algorithms. For instance, it reaches 7% higher accuracy compared to decision tree models when detecting fraudulent claims.

The complexity of the recursive methods is linear, and this complexity allows the estimation of parameters in real time. Most of the recursive parameter estimation methods use Gaussian mixtures and do not explore other distributions. However, the underlying structure of the data might be non-Gaussian. Thus, we propose a novel recursive method for estimating the parameters of the Dirichlet HMM. The Dirichlet distribution is popular because of its flexibility in modelling data. The proposed estimation is based on the maximum likelihood method, which is known to give close to optimal results.

Yet, since the algorithm is restricted to one memory architecture, the variety of possible alternatives is limited by design in favor of an overall model consistency. Moreover, it does not actively detect drift, thus adapting with a relatively high delay in case of abrupt changes. We propose a dynamic ensemble on the basis of the SAM algorithm, which is triggered by both, the inherent passive adaptation of SAM and active drift detection. Further, since SAM is based on the stable k-Nearest-Neighbor algorithm, we investigate multiple approaches to obtain a high diversity in the ensemble, resulting in an effective overall strategy.

Artificial intelligence techniques can be used to analyze and learn useful standards from clinical datasets to provide better evidence to support the decisions of health professionals and thus help to improve patient health outcomes in hospitals. This systematic literature review aims to provide an updated computational perspective of how artificial intelligence has been applied to analyze the vital signs of adult hospitalized patients and the outcomes obtained. To this end, we reviewed 2899 scientific articles published between 2008 and 2018 and selected 78 articles that met our inclusion criteria to answer the research questions. Moreover, we used the information found in the reviewed articles to propose a taxonomy and identified the main concerns, challenges, and opportunities in this field. Our findings demonstrate that many researchers are exploring the use of artificial intelligence methods in tasks related to improving the health outcomes of hospitalized patients in distinct units. Additionally, although vital signs are significant predictors of clinical deterioration, they are not analyzed in isolation to predict or identify a clinical outcome.

When a time series is generated by non-stationary phenomena, the pattern relating the series with the class to be predicted may evolve over time (concept drift). Consequently, predictive models aimed to learn this pattern may become eventually obsolete, hence failing to sustain performance levels of practical use. To overcome this model degradation, online learning methods incrementally learn from new data samples arriving over time, and accommodate eventual changes along the data stream by implementing assorted concept drift strategies. In this manuscript we elaborate on the suitability of online learning methods to predict the road congestion level based on traffic speed time series data. We draw interesting insights on the performance degradation when the forecasting horizon is increased. As opposed to what is done in most literature, we provide evidence of the importance of assessing the distribution of classes over time before designing and tuning the learning model. This previous exercise may give a hint of the predictability of the different congestion levels under target. Experimental results are discussed over real traffic speed data captured by inductive loops deployed over Seattle (USA). Several online learning methods are analyzed, from traditional incremental learning algorithms to more elaborated deep learning models. As shown by the reported results, when increasing the prediction horizon, the performance of all models degrade severely due to the distribution of classes along time, which supports our claim about the importance of analyzing this distribution prior to the design of the model.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1109/IJCNN48605.2020.9207661","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-07-28T12:23:11.908Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"bZVftihtTxycA2XO0fxS5g==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"61014c2fd112b71809959b18"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"je+rDRPnR8+WfZbmtBS1PA==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"Adaptive scheduling for adaptive sampling in pos taggers construction","authors":["M.

Using supervised learning (SL), this paper proposes a new strategy for optimal DR of an HVAC system in a multi-zone building. Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are trained with data obtained under normal building operating conditions. The ANNs are replicated using piecewise linear equations, which are explicitly integrated into an optimization problem for price-based DR. The problem is solved for various electricity prices and building thermal conditions. The solutions are used to train a deep neural network (DNN) to directly determine the optimal DR schedule, which is termed as SL-aided meta-prediction (SLAMP) here; the DNN can work as a price-and-optimal-demand curve. Case studies are performed using three different methods: explicit ANN replication, SLAMP, and physics-based modeling.

Accordingly, this research proposes Correlation-Based Incremental Learning Network (CILN) using the Correlation Distance method to measure similarity and the Gaussian membership function to determine membership of each node. The gas sensor array data is used to verify the proposed algorithm by choosing 16 steady-state features (DR) from 13,910 records which are divided into 6 classes: 1) Ethanol, 2) Ethylene, 3) Ammonia, 4) Acetaldehyde, 5) Acetone, and 6) Toluene. The data are normalized and divided as the training sets into 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, and 50%, respectively. The proposed algorithm was compared with well-known classifiers. CILN experiment results yield the highest accuracy of 98.96% using 50% of the training data set. It shows that CILN has the incremental learning ability and can be used with data that fluctuate according to the situation.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.25046/aj050479","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-07-28T12:23:13.360Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"bZVftihtTxycA2XO0fxS5g==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"61014c32d112b71809959b1e"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"UVX4wViqR3iKkz3YBaF95Q==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"Multiclass Oblique Random Forests With Dual-Incremental Learning Capacity","authors":["Zheng Chai","Chunhui Zhao"],"date":{"$date":"2020-07-28T00:00:00.000Z"},"pdf_url":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8968755","abstract":"Oblique random forests (ObRFs) have attracted increasing attention recently. Their popularity is mainly driven by learning oblique hyperplanes instead of expensively searching for axis-aligned hyperplanes in the standard random forest. However, most existing methods are trained in an off-line mode, which assumes that the training data are given as a batch. Efficient dual-incremental learning (DIL) strategies for ObRF have rarely been explored when new inputs from the existing classes or unseen classes come. The goal of this article is to provide an ObRF with DIL capacity to perform classification on-the-fly. First, we propose a batch multiclass ObRF (ObRF-BM) algorithm by using a broad learning system and a multi-to-binary method to obtain an optimal oblique hyperplane in a higher dimensional space and then separate the samples into two supervised clusters at each node, which provides the basis for the following incremental learning strategy. Then, the DIL strategy for ObRF-BM, termed ObRF-DIL, is developed by analytically updating the parameters of all nodes on the classification route of the increment of input samples and the increment of input classes so that the ObRF-BM model can be effectively updated without laborious retraining from scratch. Experimental results using several public data sets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach in comparison with several state-of-the-art methods.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1109/TNNLS.2020.2964737","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-07-28T12:23:14.094Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"bZVftihtTxycA2XO0fxS5g==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"61014c32d112b71809959b1f"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"F82dGw/oQLWw430KIK/rBg==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"Lambda Learner: Fast Incremental Learning on Data Streams","authors":["R.

Parallelized batch offline training, although horizontally scalable, is often not time-considerate or cost-effective. In this paper, we propose Lambda Learner, a new framework for training models by incremental updates in response to mini-batches from data streams.

Recently, several network embedding methods are proposed to learn embeddings on such networks incrementally. However, these methods perform incremental updates in a heuristic manner and thus fail to quantitatively restrict the differences between incremental learning and direct learning on the entire network (i.e., the batch learning). Moreover, they ignore the node labels (e.g., interests) when learning node embeddings, which undermines the performance of network embeddings for applications such as node classification. To solve this problem, in this paper we propose a novel network embedding framework, Di scri m inative S tream i ng Network E m bedding (DimSim). When an edge insertion/deletion occurs, DimSim fast learns node embeddings incrementally, which is desired for many online applications such as anomaly detection. With the incremental learning method, at any time, the objective function well approximates to that of batch learning on the current snapshot. More importantly, the average amount of updating operations of DimSim for processing each newly coming edge is about O ( n 1 − λ ) , where λ is constant between 1 and 2 and n is the number of nodes. As a result, DimSim can be increasingly fast as the network grows, which adheres to the intuition that an edge insertion/deletion has a smaller impact on larger networks. In addition, we also utilize node label information to learn discriminative node embeddings and we deliberately design a new model to automatically trade-off the node-specific importance of topology and label information. Extensive experiments on real-world streaming networks show that our method DimSim is up to 50 times faster and 40% more accurate than the state-of-the-arts.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1016/j.knosys.2019.105138","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-07-28T12:23:14.487Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"bZVftihtTxycA2XO0fxS5g==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"61014c32d112b71809959b21"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"JD4eRsJTRaqq6talTEAfhw==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"Toward Intelligent Industrial Informatics: A Review of Current Developments and Future Directions of Artificial Intelligence in Industrial Applications","authors":["Daswin de Silva","S.

Aiming to solve the problem of identification model updating, a novel framework for performance pattern identification of the CESs based on the artificial immune systems and incremental learning is proposed in this paper to classify real-time monitoring data into different performance patterns. First, an unsupervised clustering technique is used to construct an initial identification model. Second, the artificial immune and outlier detection algorithms are applied to identify abnormal data and determine the type of immune response. Third, incremental learning is employed to trace the dynamic changes of patterns, and operations such as pattern insertion, pattern removal, and pattern revision are designed to realize automatic and adaptive updates of an identification model. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is demonstrated through experiments with the benchmark and actual pattern identification applications. As an unsupervised and self-adapting approach, the proposed framework inherits the preponderances of the conventional methods but overcomes some of their drawbacks because the retraining process is not required in perceiving the pattern changes. Therefore, this method can be flexibly and efficiently used for performance pattern identification of the CESs. Moreover, the proposed method provides a foundation for fault detection and condition prediction, and can be used in other engineering applications.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1007/S11431-019-9532-5","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-07-28T12:23:16.162Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"bZVftihtTxycA2XO0fxS5g==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"61014c34d112b71809959b24"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"6SkDzyF0SJq7crCkajgtgw==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"PWIDB: A framework for learning to classify imbalanced data streams with incremental data re-balancing technique","authors":["R.

The PWIDB framework combines automated balancing techniques using Racing Algorithm (RA) and incremental rebalancing technique. RA is an active learning approach capable of classifying imbalanced data and can provide a way to select an appropriate re-balancing technique with imbalanced data. In this paper, we have extended the capability of RA for handling imbalanced data streams in the proposed PWIDB framework. The PWIDB accumulates previous knowledge with increments of re-balanced data and captures the concept of the imbalanced instances. The PWIDB is an incremental streaming batch framework, which is suitable for learning with streaming imbalanced data. We compared the performance of PWIDB with a well-known FLORA technique. Experimental results show that the PWIDB framework exhibits an improved and stable performance compared to FLORA and accumulative re-balancing techniques.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1016/j.procs.2020.09.077","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-07-28T12:23:16.339Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"bZVftihtTxycA2XO0fxS5g==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"61014c34d112b71809959b25"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"0ZyCSk/0QV2Ee9YDEFbONQ==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"Incremental and Decremental Fuzzy Bounded Twin Support Vector Machine","authors":["Alexandre Reeberg de Mello","M.

(2) As new observations of old classes come sequentially over time, the distribution may change in unforeseen way, making the performance degrade dramatically on future data, which is referred to as concept drift.

The main challenge lies in the fact that big data sources usually formed in a continuous data stream. Thus, many previous researches present incremental data mining approaches to deal with the challenges of the data streams by adapting traditional machine learning algorithms. Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is a common technique in this field. The main challenge is how to optimize the neural network parameters to deal with a huge data arrive over time. These parameters, which are vital for the performance of a neural network, are called hyperparameters. Most earlier optimization approaches have dealt with big data containers instead of big data streams or handled big data streams with time consumed. This paper proposes an incremental learning process for ANN hyperparameters optimization over data stream by utilizing Grasshopper Algorithm (GOA) as a swarm intelligence technique. GOA is utilized to make a balance between exploration and exploitation to find the best set of ANN hyperparameters suitable for data stream. The experimental results illustrate that the proposed optimization model yields better accuracy results with appropriate CPU time.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1007/978-3-030-44289-7_20","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-07-28T12:23:17.351Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"bZVftihtTxycA2XO0fxS5g==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"61014c35d112b71809959b2d"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"/KJc6v2fQ9Ku3gtll+ZW7w==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"An Appraisal of Incremental Learning Methods","authors":["Yong Luo","Liancheng Yin","Wenchao Bai","Keming Mao"],"date":{"$date":"2020-07-28T00:00:00.000Z"},"pdf_url":"https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/df25/dcd54c427eb1856217b546f970198272e107.pdf","abstract":"As a special case of machine learning, incremental learning can acquire useful knowledge from incoming data continuously while it does not need to access the original data. It is expected to have the ability of memorization and it is regarded as one of the ultimate goals of artificial intelligence technology. However, incremental learning remains a long term challenge. Modern deep neural network models achieve outstanding performance on stationary data distributions with batch training. This restriction leads to catastrophic forgetting for incremental learning scenarios since the distribution of incoming data is unknown and has a highly different probability from the old data. Therefore, a model must be both plastic to acquire new knowledge and stable to consolidate existing knowledge. This review aims to draw a systematic review of the state of the art of incremental learning methods. Published reports are selected from Web of Science, IEEEXplore, and DBLP databases up to May 2020. Each paper is reviewed according to the types: architectural strategy, regularization strategy and rehearsal and pseudo-rehearsal strategy. We compare and discuss different methods. Moreover, the development trend and research focus are given. It is concluded that incremental learning is still a hot research area and will be for a long period. More attention should be paid to the exploration of both biological systems and computational models.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.3390/e22111190","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-07-28T12:23:17.454Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"bZVftihtTxycA2XO0fxS5g==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"61014c36d112b71809959b2e"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"zhJDsPdDR+aK/C5i4zAtnQ==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"Input Addition and Deletion in Reinforcement: Towards Learning with Structural Changes","authors":["Iago Bonnici","Abdelkader Gouaïch","F.

They work on input/output data streams called lstatesž, lactionsž and lrewardsž. Most current research about RL adaptiveness to changes works under the assumption that the streams signatures (i.e. arity and types of inputs and outputs) remain the same throughout the agent lifetime. As a consequence , natural situations where the signatures vary (e.g. when new data streams become available, or when others become obsolete) are not studied. In this paper, we relax this assumption and consider that signature changes define a new learning situation called Protean Learning (PL). When they occur, traditional RL agents become undefined, so they need to restart learning. Can better methods be developed under the PL view? To investigate this, we first construct a stream-oriented formalism to properly define PL and signature changes. Then, we run experiments in an idealized PL situation where input addition and deletion occur during the learning process. Results show that a simple PL-oriented method enables graceful adaptation of these arity changes, and is more efficient than restarting the process.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.5555/3398761.3398787","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-07-28T12:23:18.453Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"bZVftihtTxycA2XO0fxS5g==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"61014c36d112b71809959b2f"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"weZliZzOQaa2R6VUILkcaw==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"Supervised-Learning-Based Optimal Thermal Management in an Electric Vehicle","authors":["Jonghyun Park","Young-Jin Kim"],"date":{"$date":"2020-07-28T00:00:00.000Z"},"pdf_url":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8939476","abstract":"Due to the increasing market share of electric vehicles (EVs), the optimal thermal management (TM) of batteries has recently received significant attention. Optimal battery temperature control is challenging, requiring a detailed model and numerous parameters of the TM system, which includes fans, pumps, compressors, and heat exchangers. This paper proposes a supervised learning strategy for the optimal operation of the TM system in an EV. Specifically, for TM subsystems, individual artificial neural networks (ANNs) are implemented and trained with data obtained under normal EV driving conditions. The ANNs are then interconnected based on the physical configuration of the TM system. The trained ANNs are replicated using piecewise linear equations, which can be explicitly integrated into an optimization problem for optimal TM scheduling. This approach enables the application of a mixed-integer linear programming solver to the problem, ensuring the optimality of the solution. Simulation case studies are performed for the two operating modes of the TM system: i.e., integrated and separate modes. The case study results demonstrate that the ANN-based model successfully reflects the operating characteristics of the TM system, enabling accurate battery temperature estimation. The proposed optimal TM strategy using the ANN-based model is verified as effective in reducing the total energy consumption, while maintaining the battery temperature within an acceptable range.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2961791","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-07-28T12:23:18.711Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"bZVftihtTxycA2XO0fxS5g==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"61014c37d112b71809959b30"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"6A2GlWv0RySl/6/6zlxPVg==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"Intelligent Clustering and Dynamic Incremental Learning to Generate Multi-Codebook Fuzzy Neural Network for Multi-Modal Data Classification","authors":["M.

To overcome the catastrophic forgetting that occurs when the network is trained sequentially on a multi-class data stream, a double consolidation class-incremental learning (DCCIL) method is proposed. In the incremental learning process, the network parameters are adjusted by combining knowledge distillation and elastic weight consolidation, so that the network can better maintain the recognition ability of the old classes while learning the new ones. The incremental learning experiment is designed, and the proposed method is compared with the popular incremental learning methods such as EWC, LwF, and iCaRL.

Most statistical learning approaches use specific size learning sets and create static models. Withal, in certain some situations such as incremental or active learning the learning process can work with only a smal amount of data. In this case, the search for algorithms capable of producing models with only a few examples begin to be necessary. Generally, the literature relative to classifiers are evaluated according to criteria such as their classification performance, their ability to sort data. But this taxonomy of classifiers can singularly evolve if one is interested in their capabilities in the presence of some few examples. From our point of view, few studies have been carried out on this issue. It is in sense that this paper seeks to study a wider range of learning algorithms as well as data sets in order to show the power of every chosen algorithm that manipulates data. It also appears from this study, problem of algorithm’s choice to process small or large amount of data. And in order to resolve this, we will show that there are algorithms able of generating models with little data. In this case we look to select the smallest amount of data allowing the best learning to be achieved. We also wanted to show that some algorithms are capable of making good predictions with little data that is therefore necessary in order to have the least costly labeling procedure possible. And to concretize this, we will talk first about learning speed and typology of the tested algorithms to know the ability of a classifier to obtain an “interesting” solution to a classification problem using a minimum of examples present in learning, and we will know some various families of classification models based on parameter learning. After that, we will test all the classifiers mentioned previously such as linear and Non-linear classifiers. Then, we will seek to study the behavior these algorithms as a function of learning set’s size trough the experimental protocol in which various datasets will be Splited, manipulated and evaluated from the classification field in order to give results that merge from our experimental protocol. After that, we will discuss the obtained results through the global analysis section, and then conclude with recommendations.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1007/s10639-020-10165-9","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-07-28T12:23:33.950Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"bZVftihtTxycA2XO0fxS5g==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"61014c46d112b71809959b37"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"m7OPW3GlTqqv/GsDq07ZiQ==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"Beyond Cross-Validation - Accuracy Estimation for Incremental and Active Learning Models","authors":["Christian Limberg","H.

To better accommodate normal behavior evolution, online anomaly detection in non-stationary data stream is formulated as a concept drift adaptation problem in this paper. It is proposed that OCSVM-based incremental learning is only performed in the case of a normal drift. For an incoming sample, its relative relationship with three sets of vectors in OCSVM, namely margin support vectors, error support vectors, and reserve vectors is fully utilized to estimate whether a normal drift is emerging.

A challenge is how to update the BCI to meet changes in electroencephalography (EEG) signals, since the resource are so limited that retraining of traditional well-performed models, such as a support vector machine, is nearly impossible. To cope with this challenge, less-demanding adaptive online learning can be considered. We investigated an adaptive projected sub-gradient method (APSM) that is originated from the set theoretic estimation formulation and the projections onto convex sets theory. APSM provides a unifying framework for both adaptive classification and regression tasks. Coefficients of APSM are adjusted online as data arrive sequentially, with a regularization constraint made by projections onto a fixed closed ball. We extended the general APSM to a shrinkage form, where shrinkage closed balls were used instead of the original fixed one, expecting a more controllable fading effect and better adaptability. The convergence of shrinkage APSM was proved. It was also demonstrated that as shrinkage factor approached to 1, the limit point of shrinkage APSM would approach to the optimal solution with the least norm, which could be especially beneficial for generalization of the classifier. The performance of the proposed method was evaluated, and compared with those of the general APSM, the incremental support vector machine, and the passive aggressive algorithm, through an event-related potential-based BCI experiment. Results showed the advantage of the proposed method over the others on both the online classification performance and the easiness of tuning.

Estimation of thermal comfort is a challenging task given the subjectivity of human perception; this subjectivity is reflected in the statistical nature of comfort models, as well as the plethora of comfort models available. Additionally, such models are using not-easily or invasively measured variables (e.g., core temperatures and metabolic rate), which are often not practical and undesirable measurements. The main goal of this paper was to develop dynamic model-based monitoring system of the occupant’s thermal state and their thermoregulation responses under two different activity levels. In total, 25 participants were subjected to three different environmental temperatures at two different activity levels. The results have shown that a reduced-ordered (second-order) multi-inputs-single-output discrete-time transfer function (MISO-DTF), including three input variables (wearables), namely, aural temperature, heart rate, and average skin heat-flux, is best to estimate the individual’s metabolic rate (non-wearable) with a mean absolute percentage error of 8.7%. A general classification model based on a least squares support vector machine (LS-SVM) technique is developed to predict the individual’s thermal sensation. For a seven-class classification problem, the results have shown that the overall model accuracy of the developed classifier is 76% with an F1-score value of 84%. The developed LS-SVM classification model for prediction of occupant’s thermal sensation can be integrated in the heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) system to provide an occupant thermal state-based climate controller. In this paper, we introduced an adaptive occupant-based HVAC predictive controller using the developed LS-SVM predictive classification model.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.3390/pr7100720","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-07-28T12:23:36.016Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"bZVftihtTxycA2XO0fxS5g==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"61014c48d112b71809959b3d"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"XeZis2syQCSyHyZXP1+UjQ==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"Adaptive Face Tracking Based on Online Learning","authors":["Aasim Khurshid","J.

Most of the available object tracking methods tend to perform satisfactorily in controlled environments but tend to fail when the objects appearance or shape changes, or even when the illumination changes (e.g., when tracking non-rigid objects such as a human face). Also, in many available tracking methods, the tracking error tends to increase indefinitely when the target is missed. Therefore, tracking the target objects in long (uninterrupted) video sequences tends to be quite challenging for these methods. This thesis proposes a face tracking algorithm that contains two operating modes. Both the operating modes are based on feature learning techniques that utilize the useful data accumulated during the face tracking and implements an incremental learning framework. To accumulate the training data, the quality of the test sample is checked before its utilization in the incremental and online training scheme. Also, a novel error prediction scheme is proposed that is capable of estimating the tracking error during the execution of the tracking algorithm. Furthermore, an improvement in the Constrained Local Model (CLM) is proposed that utilize the training data to assign weights to the landmarks based on their consistency. These weights are used in the CLM search process to improve CLM search optimization process. The experimental results show that the proposed tracking method (both variants) perform better than the comparative state of the art methods in terms of Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and Center Location Error (CLE). In order to prove the efficiency of the proposed techniques, an application in yawning detection is presented.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.5753/SIBGRAPI.EST.2019.8297","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-07-28T12:23:36.226Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"bZVftihtTxycA2XO0fxS5g==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"61014c48d112b71809959b3e"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"STP9tvJXTVmfiY0GkXJX1Q==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"CPS data streams analytics based on machine learning for Cloud and Fog Computing: A survey","authors":["Xiang Fei","N.

One characteristic of CPS is the reciprocal feedback loops between physical processes and cyber elements (computation, software and networking), which implies that data stream analytics is one of the core components of CPS. The reasons for this are: (i) it extracts the insights and the knowledge from the data streams generated by various sensors and other monitoring components embedded in the physical systems; (ii) it supports informed decision making; (iii) it enables feedback from the physical processes to the cyber counterparts; (iv) it eventually facilitates the integration of cyber and physical systems. There have been many successful applications of data streams analytics, powered by machine learning techniques, to CPS systems. Thus, it is necessary to have a survey on the particularities of the application of machine learning techniques to the CPS domain. In particular, we explore how machine learning methods should be deployed and integrated in Cloud and Fog architectures for better fulfilment of the requirements of mission criticality and time criticality arising in CPS domains. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first to systematically study machine learning techniques for CPS data stream analytics from various perspectives, especially from a perspective that leads to the discussion and guidance of how the CPS machine learning methods should be deployed in a Cloud and Fog architecture.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1016/j.future.2018.06.042","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-07-28T12:23:36.339Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"bZVftihtTxycA2XO0fxS5g==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"61014c48d112b71809959b3f"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"Pun6HI+kTqSLozCHjJAm8A==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"Handling Unforeseen Failures Using Argumentation-Based Learning","authors":["H.

This representation leads to a particularly intuitive classification scheme, since prototypes can be inspected by a human partner in the same way as data points. Yet, it bears the risk of revealing private information included in the training data, since individual information of a single training data point can significantly influence the location of a prototype. In this contribution, we investigate the question how to algorithmically extend LVQ such that it provably obeys privacy constraints as offered by the notion of so-called differential privacy. More precisely, we demonstrate the sensitivity of LVQ to single data points and hence the need of its extension to private variants in case of possibly sensitive training data. We investigate three technologies which have been proposed in the context of differential privacy, and we extend these technologies to LVQ schemes. We investigate the effectiveness and efficiency of these schemes for various data sets, and we evaluate their scalability and robustness as regards the choice of meta-parameters and characteristics of training sets. Interestingly, one algorithm, which has been proposed in the literature due to its beneficial mathematical properties, does not scale well with data dimensionality, while two alternative techniques, which are based on simpler principles, display good results in practical settings.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1016/J.NEUCOM.2018.11.095","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-07-28T12:23:37.752Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"bZVftihtTxycA2XO0fxS5g==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"61014c4ad112b71809959b41"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"7UOPCje4QTGxwLEqBq43Wg==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"Streaming Classification of Variable Stars","authors":["Lukas Zorich","K.

Using machine learning techniques for this task has proven to be quite useful. Typically, machine learning classifiers used for this task require to have a fixed training set, and the training process is performed offline. Upcoming surveys such as the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) will generate new observations daily, where an automatic classification system able to create alerts online will be mandatory. A system with those characteristics must be able to update itself incrementally. Unfortunately, after training, most machine learning classifiers do not support the inclusion of new observations in light curves, they need to re-train from scratch. Naively re-training from scratch is not an option in streaming settings, mainly because of the expensive pre-processing routines required to obtain a vector representation of light curves (features) each time we include new observations. In this work, we propose a streaming probabilistic classification model; it uses a set of newly designed features that work incrementally. With this model, we can have a machine learning classifier that updates itself in real time with new observations. To test our approach, we simulate a streaming scenario with light curves from CoRot, OGLE and MACHO catalogs. Results show that our model achieves high classification performance, staying an order of magnitude faster than traditional classification approaches.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1093/mnras/stz3426","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-07-28T12:23:38.028Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"bZVftihtTxycA2XO0fxS5g==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"61014c4ad112b71809959b42"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"gX7afhwnQce9PpT6lVrqZQ==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"Incremental Electricity Consumer Behavior Learning Using Smart Meter Data","authors":["Zigui Jiang","Rongheng Lin","Fangchun Yang"],"date":{"$date":"2019-07-28T00:00:00.000Z"},"pdf_url":"http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3335517","abstract":"Electricity consumption behavior features can be represented by the load patterns extracted from daily load data clustering.

Given the existed load patterns and new daily load data, the method first extracts new load patterns from new data, and then intergrades the existed load patterns with the new ones. Finally, an addition modification is performed on the intergraded sets to obtain the optimal updated load patterns. Several essential parameters are updated after this procedure so that the algorithm can be performed continuously. Extensive experiments are implemented on real-world dataset.

In the MLM, the feature mapping in this step corresponds to distance calculations between the training data and a set of reference points, whereas in the ELM, a transformation using a radial or sigmoidal activation function is commonly used. Computation of the model output, for prediction or classification purposes, is straightforward with the ELM after the first step. In the original MLM, one needs to solve an additional multilateration problem for the estimation of the distance-regression based output. A natural combination of these two techniques is proposed and experimented here: to use the distance-based basis characteristic in the MLM in the learning framework of the regularized ELM. In other words, we conduct ridge regression using a distance-based basis. The experimental results characterize the basic features of the proposed technique and surprisingly, indicate that overlearning with the distance-based basis is in practice avoided in classification problems.

The concept of virtual sensors provides a step towards this goal, however they are often used to denote homogeneous types of data, generally retrieved from a predetermined group of sensors. The DIVS (Dynamic Intelligent Virtual Sensors) concept was introduced in previous work to extend and generalize the notion of a virtual sensor to a dynamic setting with heterogenous sensors. This paper introduces a refined version of the DIVS concept by integrating an interactive machine learning mechanism, which enables the system to take input from both the user and the physical world. The paper empirically validates some of the properties of the DIVS concept. In particular, we are concerned with the distribution of different budget allocations for labelled data, as well as proactive labelling user strategies.

The research community has solved this problem by applying machine learning techniques and has managed to reduce the computational and time costs in comparison with the traditional thermodynamical analysis. Until now, this challenge has been tackled from a batch learning perspective in which data is assumed to be at rest, and where models do not continuously integrate new information into already constructed models. We present an approach closer to the Big Data and Internet of Things paradigms in which data is arriving continuously and where models learn incrementally, achieving significant enhancements in terms of data processing (time, memory and computational costs), and obtaining competitive performances.

The heuristic design of GFS uses evolutionary algorithms for optimizing both Mamdani-type and Takagi–Sugeno–Kang-type fuzzy systems. Whereas, the NFS combines the FIS with neural network learning systems to improve the approximation ability. An HFS combines two or more low-dimensional fuzzy logic units in a hierarchical design to overcome the curse of dimensionality. An EFS solves the data streaming issues by evolving the system incrementally, and an MFS solves the multi-objective trade-offs like the simultaneous maximization of both interpretability and accuracy. This paper ofers a synthesis of these dimensions and explores their potentials, challenges, and opportunities in FIS research.

At the core of such applications there is a need for machine learning (ML) to create value from the data at the edge. Current ML systems transfer data from geo-distributed streams to a central datacenter for modeling. The model is then moved to the edge and used for inference or classification. These systems can be ineffective because they introduce significant demand for data movement and model transfer in the critical path of learning. Furthermore, a full model may not be needed at each edge location. An alternative is to train and update the models online at each edge with local data, in isolation from other edges. Still, this approach can worsen the accuracy of models due to reduced data availability, especially in the presence of local data shifts. In this paper we propose Cartel, a system for collaborative learning in edge clouds, that creates a model-sharing environment in which tailored models at each edge can quickly adapt to changes, and can be as robust and accurate as centralized models. Results show that Cartel adapts to workload changes 4 to 8x faster than isolated learning, and reduces model size, training time and total data transfer by 3x, 5.7x and ~1500x, respectively, when compared to centralized learning.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1145/3357223.3362708","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-07-28T12:23:42.386Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"bZVftihtTxycA2XO0fxS5g==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"61014c5bd112b71809959b53"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"99KC0vdwT92/zrAiR/+8tA==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"Human face detection improvement using incremental learning based on low variance directions","authors":["Takoua Kefi-Fatteh","Riadh Ksantini","M.

This paper proposes a hybrid incremental regression neural network based on self-organizing incremental neural network and incremental fuzzy support vector regression. In our proposed network, the neurons of the regression neural network are obtained by an improved self-organized incremental neural network (SOINN). This enables the regression neural network structure to self-organize as the number of neurons increases. An incremental fuzzy support vector regression (IFSVR) algorithm is then used to modify the parameters of the regression neural network.

On the other hand, Incremental Learning (IncL) exploits the fact that extending the obtained knowledge, is less time and resource consuming than producing it from scratch. With aspect to this notion, incremental learners use incoming data to further train and adjust the existing models, rather to retrain them from the beginning. Both of the aforementioned approaches come with a number of advantages, which established them as promising techniques among researchers. In this work, we propose an incrementally updateable ensemble learner that maintains the benefits of both IncL and Ensemble theory. To prove the efficiency of the proposed method, a series of rigorous experiments over 32 datasets were executed, measuring the metric of classification accuracy, as well as Cohen's kappa score, since the adopted test case regards only multiclass problems.

Decision trees are extremely fast, highly accurate and easy to use in practice. Merging multiple decision trees to an ensemble leads to one of the most powerful machine learning methods. The Very Fast Decision Tree is the state-of-the-art incremental decision tree induction algorithm, capable of learning from massive data streams. It is successful due to its theoretical guarantees based on the Hoeffding bound as well as its competitive performance in terms of classification accuracy and time / space efficiency. In this paper, we increase the efficiency even further by replacing its global splitting scheme, which periodically tries to split every n_min examples. Instead, we utilize local statistics to predict the split-time, thus, avoiding unnecessary split-attempts, usually dominating the computational cost. Concretely, we use the class distributions of previous split-attempts to approximate the minimum number of examples until the Hoeffding bound is met. This cautious approach yields by design a low delay and reduces the number of split-attempts at the same time. We extensively evaluate our method using common stream-learning benchmarks also considering non-stationary environments. The experiments confirm a substantially reduced run-time without a loss in classification performance.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1109/ICDM.2018.00044","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-07-28T12:24:00.276Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"bZVftihtTxycA2XO0fxS5g==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"61014c60d112b71809959b63"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"I7irBlpdTH+a1iu/ynqWwA==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"McDiarmid Drift Detection Methods for Evolving Data Streams","authors":["Ali Pesaranghader","H.

Such data are not only unbounded and rapidly evolving. Rather, the content thereof dynamically evolves over time, often in unforeseen ways. These variations are due to so-called concept drifts, caused by changes in the underlying data generation mechanisms. In a classification setting, concept drift causes the previously learned models to become inaccurate, unsafe and even unusable. Accordingly, concept drifts need to be detected, and handled, as soon as possible. In medical applications and emergency response settings, for example, change in behaviours should be detected in near real-time, to avoid potential loss of life. To this end, we introduce the McDiarmid Drift Detection Method (MDDM), which utilizes McDiarmid’s inequality [1] in order to detect concept drift. The MDDM approach proceeds by sliding a window over prediction results, and associate window entries with weights. Higher weights are assigned to the most recent entries, in order to emphasize their importance. As instances are processed, the detection algorithm compares a weighted mean of elements inside the sliding window with the maximum weighted mean observed so far. A significant difference between the two weighted means, upper-bounded by the McDiarmid inequality, implies a concept drift. Our extensive experimentation against synthetic and real-world data streams show that our novel method outperforms the state-of-the-art. Specifically, MDDM yields shorter detection delays as well as lower false negative rates, while maintaining high classification accuracies.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2018.8489260","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-07-28T12:24:00.688Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"bZVftihtTxycA2XO0fxS5g==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"61014c60d112b71809959b64"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"C/XTwdV/TgeyToODGGMvDQ==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"A Reservoir of Adaptive Algorithms for Online Learning from Evolving Data Streams","authors":["Ali Pesaranghader"],"date":{"$date":"2018-07-28T00:00:00.000Z"},"pdf_url":"https://doi.org/10.20381/ruor-22444","abstract":"Continuous change and development are essential aspects of evolving environments and applications, including, but not limited to, smart cities, military, medicine, nuclear reactors, self-driving cars, aviation, and aerospace. That is, the fundamental characteristics of such environments may evolve, and so cause dangerous consequences, e.g., putting people lives at stake, if no reaction is adopted. Therefore, learning systems need to apply intelligent algorithms to monitor evolvement in their environments and update themselves effectively. Further, we may experience fluctuations regarding the performance of learning algorithms due to the nature of incoming data as it continuously evolves. That is, the current efficient learning approach may become deprecated after a change in data or environment. Hence, the question ‘how to have an efficient learning algorithm over time against evolving data? ’ has to be addressed. In this thesis, we have made two contributions to settle the challenges described above. In the machine learning literature, the phenomenon of (distributional) change in data is known as concept drift. Concept drift may shift decision boundaries, and cause a decline in accuracy. Learning algorithms, indeed, have to detect concept drift in evolving data streams and replace their predictive models accordingly. To address this challenge, adaptive learners have been devised which may utilize drift detection methods to locate the drift points in dynamic and changing data streams. A drift detection method able to discover the drift points quickly, with the lowest false positive and false negative rates, is preferred. False positive refers to incorrectly alarming for concept drift, and false negative refers to not alarming for concept drift. In this thesis, we introduce three algorithms, called as the Fast Hoeffding Drift Detection Method (FHDDM), the Stacking Fast Hoeffding Drift Detection Method (FHDDMS), and the McDiarmid Drift Detection Methods (MDDMs), for detecting drift points with the minimum delay, false positive, and false negative rates. FHDDM is a sliding window-based algorithm and applies Hoeffding’s inequality (Hoeffding, 1963) to detect concept drift. FHDDM slides its window over the prediction results, which are either 1 (for a correct prediction) or 0 (for a wrong prediction). Meanwhile, it compares the mean of elements inside the window with the maximum mean observed so far; subsequently, a significant difference between the two means, upper-bounded by the Hoeffding inequality, indicates the occurrence of concept drift. The FHDDMS extends the FHDDM algorithm by sliding multiple windows over its entries for a better drift detection regarding the detection delay and false negative rate. In contrast to FHDDM/S, the MDDM variants assign weights to their entries, i.e., higher weights are associated with the most recent entries in the sliding window, for faster detection of concept drift. The rationale is that recent examples reflect the ongoing situation adequately. Then, by putting higher weights on the latest entries, we may detect concept drift quickly. An MDDM algorithm bounds the difference between the weighted mean of elements in the sliding window and the maximum weighted mean seen so far, using McDiarmid’s inequality (McDiarmid, 1989).

For instance, there is no consensus if the performance of the classification methods is affected when they are used in real-world scenarios that require online learning. Moreover, it is also not known if the performance of the methods decreases due to the time-ordered nature of the reviews. To answer these and other important open questions, this work presents a comprehensive analysis of content-based classification methods for fake review detection.

The determination of optimal operating strategies requires intelligent utilization of massive data accumulated during operation or prediction. The investigation of these data solely without combining physical models may run the risk that the established relationships between inputs and outputs, the models which reproduce the behavior of the considered system/component in a wide range of boundary conditions, are invalid for certain boundary conditions, which never occur in the database employed. Therefore, combining big data with physical models via cyber physical systems (CPS) is of great importance to derive highly-reliable and -accurate models and becomes more and more popular in practical applications. In this paper, we focus on the description of a systematic method to apply CPS to the performance analysis and decision making of thermal power plants. We proposed a general procedure of CPS with both offline and online phases for its application to thermal power plants and discussed the corresponding methods employed to support each sub-procedure. As an example, a data-driven model of turbine island of an existing air-cooling based thermal power plant is established with the proposed procedure and demonstrates its practicality, validity and flexibility. To establish such model, the historical operating data are employed in the cyber layer for modeling and linking each physical component. The decision-making procedure of optimal frequency of air-cooling condenser is also illustrated to show its applicability of online use. It is concluded that the cyber physical system with the data mining technique is effective and promising to facilitate the real-time analysis and control of thermal power plants.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.3390/EN11040690","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-07-28T12:24:01.183Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"bZVftihtTxycA2XO0fxS5g==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"61014c62d112b71809959b67"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"rIiYKVbAQKCs9WLeBaMk5w==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"VIAL: a unified process for visual interactive labeling","authors":["J.

Streaming data which constantly arrives over time is unstructured, and classifying these data is a tedious task as they lack class labels and get accumulated over time. As the data keeps growing, it becomes difficult to train and create a model from scratch each time. Incremental learning, a self-adaptive algorithm uses the previously learned model information, then learns and accommodates new information from the newly arrived data providing a new model, which avoids the retraining. The incrementally learned knowledge helps to classify the unstructured data. In this paper, we propose a framework CUIL (Classification of Unstructured data using Incremental Learning) which clusters the metadata, assigns a label for each cluster and then creates a model using Extreme Learning Machine (ELM), a feed-forward neural network, incrementally for each batch of data arrived. The proposed framework trains the batches separately, reducing the memory resources, training time significantly and is tested with metadata created for the standard image datasets like MNIST, STL-10, CIFAR-10, Caltech101, and Caltech256. Based on the tabulated results, our proposed work proves to show greater accuracy and efficiency.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.3390/a11100158","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-07-28T12:24:02.648Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"bZVftihtTxycA2XO0fxS5g==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"61016023d112b71809959b6c"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"st2FgwsQSTCUhiZ3MzoGGg==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"Differentiable Direct Volume Rendering","authors":["Weiss, Sebastian","Westermann, Rüdiger"],"date":{"$date":"2021-07-27T00:00:00.000Z"},"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.12672","abstract":" We present a differentiable volume rendering solution that provides\ndifferentiability of all continuous parameters of the volume rendering process.\nThis differentiable renderer is used to steer the parameters towards a setting\nwith an optimal solution of a problem-specific objective function.

Similar cognitive constraints emerge in several aspects of our daily life, from our mobility to the way we communicate, and might even affect the way we consume information online. Indeed, despite the unprecedented amount of information we can access online, our attention span still remains limited. Furthermore, recent studies have shown that online users are more likely to ignore dissenting information, choosing instead to interact with information adhering to their own point of view. In this paper, we quantitatively analyse users’ attention economy in news consumption on social media by analysing 14 million users interacting with 583 news outlets (pages) on Facebook over a time span of six years. In particular, we explore how users distribute their activity across news pages and topics. On the one hand, we find that, independently of their activity, users show a tendency to follow a very limited number of pages. On the other hand, users tend to interact with almost all the topics presented by their favoured pages. Finally, we introduce a taxonomy accounting for users’ behaviour to distinguish between patterns of selective exposure and interest. Our findings suggest that segregation of users in echo chambers might be an emerging effect of users’ activity on social media and that selective exposure—i.e. the tendency of users to consume information adhering to their preferred narratives—could be a major driver in their consumption patterns.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1371/journal.pone.0229129","journal_title":"PLOS ONE"},"created_by":{"$binary":"YdVf1RwtQ2uUIKodj0thwA==","$type":"4"},"proposed_to":[],"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-07-28T15:10:14.216Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"RLH2us8+RXmm2h1pVo9pMA==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"PY9EfJ/mTL2nV5zKupzpWQ==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"Pq8JBJGgRg+JG1vTbdyPYg==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"gt77uxyGRbCut63S39l7eQ==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"PC7SF9JXTHqcrI3uQ62s1Q==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"IX9JCzU0STiTsoqK+bMHaA==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"azC/UD/sSrizZcIqeDx4Vg==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"hyIPdHOSSt+NrW625+PZDw==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"g3fl6pg2Sdi+hR5V2f2VEQ==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"Sc8hKZv2SPO+xYi9DzMqEw==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"G6MVstNlScu/07u/UhekWA==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"iRU9JwnYTVqFV/GeVYy19Q==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"B6HFeHMbT7WiDVVHA5Mm8Q==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"zgp9uHDJRGiAaJnYvyHkFg==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"FqCOYxISQcSpZxw0eWvhiQ==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"//xsgF5nToK/cj0rYgvPNg==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"luNHnskBQ6GSxz+esobPFA==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"YvPYbyMFR6O5Izt/66uLzA==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"idOvKaOqSlidUkRggJWPQw==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"RYfod/7/QIK5icTokI45uQ==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"XU2LJJ9LQEiTJCN9MnvjJg==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"JKlKwj+uTl+S9iaekUKMLw==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"ilOgZvbeQYaWA1PytKYTMg==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"DfiTRUDzSPqsMwi2e3D/ZQ==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"BH/pqwvXRDy6NG7SRbbP8Q==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"eiX/jSnuTQC8/BTd+CArCw==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"mvT0dnarRkKcfcjK+xgJmw==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"qh/bdUCJTZ6ufI0PHGZQfA==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"O5srLphvQdGu5FF0UyXeQQ==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"yGZm+Ud4SdGOeQcHBkF8IA==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"MboPk+HcQr283Kg/7T/02w==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"lEUz7VQbSuOyi3nCchFPDw==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"k0R9cYwTSleOUiXzFft8+w==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"PX8BbW9wRcSKXHKX2+PtTw==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"jJcq4la8Swet21rKACaa2Q==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"5n0TofQMStqOol8/6nm+jA==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"vohGgK0nRAShSZnhOKqPog==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"F8Th+kaqQduflzlG/Fn8bQ==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"dC7F3pdJQN23kpzjIubpSg==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"sogqcPcnQu+U48bTH5cmew==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"j1P3jIQDQ76Z5Ez896LLAA==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"RSKNanJnQe2ayLsYHVKSQg==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"g8r7Z69oTsmtSNg1ztWAqg==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"H427L2wNT0SjmJLlWbaQFA==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"C61t6ONlSN2PUmCRjZJn8A==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"rI+9DVQGQ16UlmJMmpZAwg==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"0MxP2NIsQVuc3pedglXx8Q==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6101736ed112b71809959b70"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"RLH2us8+RXmm2h1pVo9pMA==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"Echo chambers online?: Politically motivated selective exposure among Internet news users","authors":["R.

However, most existing methods used to obtain the modular structure of networks suffer from serious problems, such as being oblivious to the statistical evidence supporting the discovered patterns, which results in the inability to separate actual structure from noise. In addition to this, one also observes a resolution limit on the size of communities, where smaller but well-defined clusters are not detectable when the network becomes large. This phenomenon occurs not only for the very popular approach of modularity optimization, which lacks built-in statistical validation, but also for more principled methods based on statistical inference and model selection, which do incorporate statistical validation in a formally correct way. Here we construct a nested generative model that, through a complete description of the entire network hierarchy at multiple scales, is capable of avoiding this limitation, and enables the detection of modular structure at levels far beyond those possible with current approaches. Even with this increased resolution, the method is based on the principle of parsimony, and is capable of separating signal from noise, and thus will not lead to the identification of spurious modules even on sparse networks. Furthermore, it fully generalizes other approaches in that it is not restricted to purely assortative mixing patterns, directed or undirected graphs, and ad hoc hierarchical structures such as binary trees. Despite its general character, the approach is tractable, and can be combined with advanced techniques of community detection to yield an efficient algorithm that scales well for very large networks.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1103/PhysRevX.4.011047","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-07-28T15:10:40.005Z"},"cited_articles":[]},{"_id":{"$oid":"61017370d112b71809959b7b"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"iRU9JwnYTVqFV/GeVYy19Q==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"Social cognition on the Internet: testing constraints on social network size","authors":["R.

The Internet, and in particular the rise of social networking sites (SNSs), raises the possibility that digital media might allow us to circumvent some or all of these constraints. This allows us to test the importance of these constraints in limiting human sociality. Although the recency of SNSs means that there have been relatively few studies, those that are available suggest that, in general, the ability to broadcast to many individuals at once, and the possibilities this provides in terms of continuously updating our understanding of network members’ behaviour and thoughts, do not allow larger networks to be maintained. This may be because only relatively weak quality relationships can be maintained without face-to-face interaction.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1098/rstb.2012.0121","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-07-28T15:10:40.188Z"},"cited_articles":[]},{"_id":{"$oid":"61017370d112b71809959b7c"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"B6HFeHMbT7WiDVVHA5Mm8Q==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"Validation of Dunbar's number in Twitter conversations","authors":["B.

A gamma process is employed to model the rate measure of a Poisson process, whose normalization provides a random probability measure for mixture modeling and whose marginalization leads to an NB process for count modeling. A draw from the NB process consists of a Poisson distributed finite number of distinct atoms, each of which is associated with a logarithmic distributed number of data samples. We reveal relationships between various count- and mixture-modeling distributions and construct a Poisson-logarithmic bivariate distribution that connects the NB and Chinese restaurant table distributions. Fundamental properties of the models are developed, and we derive efficient Bayesian inference. It is shown that with augmentation and normalization, the NB process and gamma-NB process can be reduced to the Dirichlet process and hierarchical Dirichlet process, respectively. These relationships highlight theoretical, structural, and computational advantages of the NB process. A variety of NB processes, including the beta-geometric, beta-NB, marked-beta-NB, marked-gamma-NB and zero-inflated-NB processes, with distinct sharing mechanisms, are also constructed. These models are applied to topic modeling, with connections made to existing algorithms under Poisson factor analysis.

We introduce a sophisticated computational model of opinion dynamics which accounts for the coexistence of media and gossip as separated mechanisms and for their feedback loops.

Contrary to the perception of ever-growing connectivity, we observe that individuals exhibit a finite communication capacity, which limits the number of ties they can maintain active in time. On average men display higher capacity than women, and this capacity decreases for both genders over their lifespan.

This pluralism has led the government to show special concern for racial income, distribution and, more generally, for racial economic disparities. The income distribution data used in this study were collected through the Post-Enumeration Survey (PES) of 1970. A comparison shows that the PES is the best source of income data to date on household and individual incomes in Malaysia. The broad features of the PES household income distribution show overall inequality in Malaysia to be fairly high. The individual income distributions show large inequalities within the racial groups. These suggest that racial income disparities may be only part of a much wider problem of income inequality in the country. A profile of poverty in Malaysia is constructed, which identifies the poor in terms of socioeconomic variables such as race, location, employment status, occupation, and education. Such information is useful not only in understanding better the correlates and circumstances of poverty, but also in identifying areas of government intervention for the redress of poverty.

Data on neocortex volume, group size and a number of behavioural ecology variables are used to test between the various theories. Group size is found to be a function of relative neocortical volume, but the ecological variables are not. This is interpreted as evidence in favour of the social intellect theory and against the ecological theories. It is suggested that the number of neocortical neurons limits the organism's information-processing capacity and that this then limits the number of relationships that an individual can monitor simultaneously. When a group's size exceeds this limit, it becomes unstable and begins to fragment. This then places an upper limit on the size of groups which any given species can maintain as cohesive social units through time. The data suggest that the information overload occurs in terms of the structure of relationships within tightly bonded grooming cliques rather than in terms of the total number of dyads within the group as a whole that an individual has to monitor. It thus appears that, among primates, large groups are created by welding together sets of smaller grooming cliques. One implication of these results is that, since the actual group size will be determined by the ecological characteristics of the habitat in any given case, species will only be able to invade habitats that require larger groups than their current limit if they evolve larger neocortices.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1016/0047-2484(92)90081-J","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-07-28T15:10:41.907Z"},"cited_articles":[]},{"_id":{"$oid":"61017372d112b71809959b88"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"BH/pqwvXRDy6NG7SRbbP8Q==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"Science vs Conspiracy: Collective Narratives in the Age of Misinformation","authors":["Alessandro Bessi","Mauro Coletto","G.

People focus a high proportion of their communication efforts on a small number of individuals, and this behavior persists even when there are changes in the identity of the individuals involved. Although social signatures vary between individuals, a given individual appears to retain a specific social signature over time. Our results are likely to reflect limitations in the ability of humans to maintain many emotionally close relationships, both because of limited time and because the emotional “capital” that individuals can allocate between family members and friends is finite. The social network maintained by a focal individual, or ego, is intrinsically dynamic and typically exhibits some turnover in membership over time as personal circumstances change. However, the consequences of such changes on the distribution of an ego’s network ties are not well understood. Here we use a unique 18-mo dataset that combines mobile phone calls and survey data to track changes in the ego networks and communication patterns of students making the transition from school to university or work. Our analysis reveals that individuals display a distinctive and robust social signature, captured by how interactions are distributed across different alters. Notably, for a given ego, these social signatures tend to persist over time, despite considerable turnover in the identity of alters in the ego network. Thus, as new network members are added, some old network members either are replaced or receive fewer calls, preserving the overall distribution of calls across network members. This is likely to reflect the consequences of finite resources such as the time available for communication, the cognitive and emotional effort required to sustain close relationships, and the ability to make emotional investments.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1073/pnas.1308540110","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-07-28T15:10:42.185Z"},"cited_articles":[]},{"_id":{"$oid":"61017372d112b71809959b8a"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"mvT0dnarRkKcfcjK+xgJmw==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"The social brain hypothesis","authors":["R.

The analysis is based on interviews conducted between December 2015 and February 2016 primarily with senior managers and editors as well as on survey data from the Reuters Institute Digital News Report.We show that:- Public service media organisations have high reach for news offline (via television and radio) in all six countries, but only in Finland and the United Kingdom do they have high reach for news online.- In all countries but Finland and the United Kingdom, significantly more people get news online from social media than from public service media.- Our interviewees highlight three particularly important issues facing public service news provision online today, namely - First, how to change organisations developed around analogue broadcasting media to effectively deliver public service news in an increasingly digital media environment. - Second, how to use mobile platforms more effectively as smartphones become more and more central to how people access news. - Third, how to use social media more effectively as more and more news use is driven by referrals and in some cases consumed off-site on platforms like Facebook.- Public service media organisations in all six countries have faced and continue to face serious challenges to their ability to effectively deliver public service news online. These include internal challenges around legacy organisations’ ability to adapt to a rapidly changing media environment and the constant evolution of new digital technologies, but also external economic and/or political challenges.- Across the three areas of organisational change, mobile delivery, and use of social media platforms, the British BBC and the Finnish Yle are generally seen as being ahead of most other public service media organisations. (Thought they too are still heavily invested in their traditional broadcasting operations and need to continue to change to keep pace with the environment.)- We identify four external conditions and two internal conditions that these two relatively high-performing organisations have in common.- The four external conditions are: (1) They operate in technologically advanced media markets. (2) They are well-funded compared to many other public service media organisations. (3) They are integrated and centrally organised public service media organisations working across all platforms. (4) They have a degree of insulation from direct political influence and greater certainty through multi-year agreements on public service remit, funding, etc.- The two internal conditions are: (1) A pro-digital culture where new media are seen as opportunities rather than as threats. (2) Senior editorial leaders who have clearly and publicly underlined the need to continually change the organisation to adapt to a changing media environment. - The need for public service news provision to evolve will only increase as our media environments continue to change and digital media become more and more important. Addressing the external conditions for the evolution of public service media is a matter for public discussion and political decision-making. Developing the internal conditions, however, is the responsibility of public service media themselves, and a precondition for their continued relevance in a rapidly changing media environment.This report is the first of a series of annual reports that will focus specifically on how European public service media are adapting to the rise of digital media, a series of reports that will over time cover more countries and more issues than those discussed here.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.2139/SSRN.2771076","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-07-28T15:11:00.003Z"},"cited_articles":[]},{"_id":{"$oid":"61017384d112b71809959b8f"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"lEUz7VQbSuOyi3nCchFPDw==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"Filter Bubbles, Echo Chambers, and Online News Consumption","authors":["S.

We find that social networks and search engines are associated with an increase in the mean ideological distance between individuals. However, somewhat counterintuitively, these same channels also are associated with an increase in an individual's exposure to material from his or her less preferred side of the political spectrum.

The wide availability of user-provided content in online social media facilitates the aggregation of people around common interests, worldviews, and narratives. However, the World Wide Web (WWW) also allows for the rapid dissemination of unsubstantiated rumors and conspiracy theories that often elicit rapid, large, but naive social responses such as the recent case of Jade Helm 15––where a simple military exercise turned out to be perceived as the beginning of a new civil war in the United States. In this work, we address the determinants governing misinformation spreading through a thorough quantitative analysis. In particular, we focus on how Facebook users consume information related to two distinct narratives: scientific and conspiracy news. We find that, although consumers of scientific and conspiracy stories present similar consumption patterns with respect to content, cascade dynamics differ. Selective exposure to content is the primary driver of content diffusion and generates the formation of homogeneous clusters, i.e., “echo chambers.” Indeed, homogeneity appears to be the primary driver for the diffusion of contents and each echo chamber has its own cascade dynamics.

We suggest that crime concentration be reported with the Lorenz curve and summarized with the Gini coefficient, and we propose generalized versions of the Lorenz curve and the Gini coefficient to correct for bias when crime data are sparse (i.e., fewer crimes than places).MethodsThe proposed generalizations are based on the principle that the observed crime concentration should not be compared with perfect equality, but with maximal equality given the data. The generalizations asymptotically approach the original Lorenz curve and the original Gini coefficient as the number of crimes approaches the number of spatial units.ResultsUsing geocoded crime data on two types of crime in the city of The Hague, we show the differences between the original Lorenz curve and Gini coefficient and the generalized versions. We demonstrate that the generalizations provide a better representation of crime concentration in situations of sparse crime data, and that they improve comparisons of crime concentration if they are sparse.ConclusionsResearchers are advised to use the generalized versions of the Lorenz curve and the Gini coefficient when reporting and summarizing crime concentration at places.

However, the disintermediated access to contents does not guarantee quality of information. Selective exposure and confirmation bias, indeed, have been shown to play a pivotal role in content consumption and information spreading. Users tend to select information adhering (and reinforcing) their worldview and to ignore dissenting information. This pattern elicits the formation of polarized groups – i.e., echo chambers – where the interaction with like-minded people might even reinforce polarization. In this work we address news consumption around Brexit in UK on Facebook. In particular, we perform a massive analysis on more than 1 million users interacting with Brexit related posts from the main news providers between January and July 2016. We show that consumption patterns elicit the emergence of two distinct communities of news outlets. Furthermore, to better characterize inner group dynamics, we introduce a new technique which combines automatic topic extraction and sentiment analysis. We compare how the same topics are presented on posts and the related emotional response on comments finding significant differences in both echo chambers and that polarization influences the perception of topics. Our results provide important insights about the determinants of polarization and evolution of core narratives on online debating.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1016/j.socnet.2017.02.002","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-07-28T15:11:03.752Z"},"cited_articles":[]},{"_id":{"$oid":"61017388d112b71809959b99"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"RSKNanJnQe2ayLsYHVKSQg==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"Evidence for a conserved quantity in human mobility","authors":["Laura Alessandretti","Piotr Sapiezynski","S.

A concurrent study has emphasized the explorative nature of human behaviour, showing that the number of visited places grows steadily over time4–7. How to reconcile these seemingly contradicting facts remains an open question. Here, we analyse high-resolution multi-year traces of ~40,000 individuals from 4 datasets and show that this tension vanishes when the long-term evolution of mobility patterns is considered. We reveal that mobility patterns evolve significantly yet smoothly, and that the number of familiar locations an individual visits at any point is a conserved quantity with a typical size of ~25. We use this finding to improve state-of-the-art modelling of human mobility4,8. Furthermore, shifting the attention from aggregated quantities to individual behaviour, we show that the size of an individual’s set of preferred locations correlates with their number of social interactions. This result suggests a connection between the conserved quantity we identify, which as we show cannot be understood purely on the basis of time constraints, and the ‘Dunbar number’9,10 describing a cognitive upper limit to an individual’s number of social relations. We anticipate that our work will spark further research linking the study of human mobility and the cognitive and behavioural sciences.Analysing high-resolution mobility traces from almost 40,000 individuals reveals that people typically revisit a set of 25 familiar locations day-to-day, but that this set evolves over time and is proportional to the size of their social sphere.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1038/s41562-018-0364-x","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-07-28T15:11:04.177Z"},"cited_articles":[]},{"_id":{"$oid":"61017388d112b71809959b9a"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"g8r7Z69oTsmtSNg1ztWAqg==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"Quantifying Controversy on Social Media","authors":["V.

Unlike previous work, rather than studying controversy in a single hand-picked topic and using domain-specific knowledge, we take a general approach to study topics in any domain. Our approach to quantifying controversy is based on a graph-based three-stage pipeline, which involves (i) building a conversation graph about a topic, (ii) partitioning the conversation graph to identify potential sides of the controversy, and (iii) measuring the amount of controversy from characteristics of the graph. We perform an extensive comparison of controversy measures, different graph-building approaches, and data sources. We use both controversial and non-controversial topics on Twitter, as well as other external datasets. We find that our new random-walk-based measure outperforms existing ones in capturing the intuitive notion of controversy and show that content features are vastly less helpful in this task.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1145/3140565","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-07-28T15:11:04.300Z"},"cited_articles":[]},{"_id":{"$oid":"61017388d112b71809959b9b"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"H427L2wNT0SjmJLlWbaQFA==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"A network approach to topic models","authors":["M.

One of the main computational and scientific challenges in the modern age is to extract useful information from unstructured texts. Topic models are one popular machine-learning approach that infers the latent topical structure of a collection of documents. Despite their success—particularly of the most widely used variant called latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA)—and numerous applications in sociology, history, and linguistics, topic models are known to suffer from severe conceptual and practical problems, for example, a lack of justification for the Bayesian priors, discrepancies with statistical properties of real texts, and the inability to properly choose the number of topics. We obtain a fresh view of the problem of identifying topical structures by relating it to the problem of finding communities in complex networks. We achieve this by representing text corpora as bipartite networks of documents and words. By adapting existing community-detection methods (using a stochastic block model (SBM) with nonparametric priors), we obtain a more versatile and principled framework for topic modeling (for example, it automatically detects the number of topics and hierarchically clusters both the words and documents). The analysis of artificial and real corpora demonstrates that our SBM approach leads to better topic models than LDA in terms of statistical model selection. Our work shows how to formally relate methods from community detection and topic modeling, opening the possibility of cross-fertilization between these two fields.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1126/sciadv.aaq1360","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-07-28T15:11:04.663Z"},"cited_articles":[]},{"_id":{"$oid":"61017389d112b71809959b9c"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"C61t6ONlSN2PUmCRjZJn8A==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"The geographic embedding of online echo chambers: Evidence from the Brexit campaign","authors":["M.

The ideas behind the PopRank are that i) high impact pages attract many users with a low engagement, which means that they receive comments from users that rarely comment, and ii) high engagement users interact with high impact pages, that is they mostly comment pages with a high popularity. The resulting ranking of pages can predict the number of comments a page will receive and the number of its future posts.

This limitation has been empirically defined in the physical and social spaces. But do people exhibit similar constraints in the digital space? We address this question through the analysis of pseudonymised mobility and mobile application (app) usage data of 400,000 individuals in a European country for six months. Despite the enormous heterogeneity of apps usage, we find that individuals exhibit a conserved capacity that limits the number of applications they regularly use. Moreover, we find that this capacity steadily decreases with age, as does the capacity in the physical space but with more complex dynamics. Even though people might have the same capacity, applications get added and removed over time. In this respect, we identify two profiles of individuals: app keepers and explorers, which differ in their stable (keepers) vs exploratory (explorers) behaviour regarding their use of mobile applications. Finally, we show that the capacity of applications predicts mobility capacity and vice-versa. By contrast, the behaviour of keepers and explorers may considerably vary across the two domains. Our empirical findings provide an intriguing picture linking human behaviour in the physical and digital worlds which bridges research studies from Computer Science, Social Physics and Computational Social Sciences.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1038/s41598-019-47493-x","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-07-28T15:11:05.468Z"},"cited_articles":[]},{"_id":{"$oid":"61017389d112b71809959ba0"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"MQiTlHRYT5qL6X06OADAXA==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"The echo chamber effect on social media","authors":["Matteo Cinelli","Gianmarco De Francisci Morales","Alessandro Galeazzi","Walter Quattrociocchi","M.

The analysis focuses on two main dimensions: 1) homophily in the interaction networks and 2) bias in the information diffusion toward like-minded peers. Our results show that the aggregation in homophilic clusters of users dominates online dynamics.

However, little is known about how exposure to artifacts of Echo Chambers, such as biased attitudinally congruent online news feeds, affects individuals’ perceptions and behavior. This study experimentally tested if exposure to attitudinally congruent online news feeds affects individuals' False Consensus Effect, that is, how strongly individuals perceive public opinions as favorably biased and in support of their own opinions. It was predicted that the extent of the False Consensus Effect is influenced by the level of agreement individuals encounter in online news feeds, with high agreement leading to a higher estimate of public support for their own opinions than low agreement. Two online experiments (n 1 = 331 and n 2 = 207) exposed participants to nine news feeds, each containing four messages. Two factors were manipulated: Agreement expressed in message texts (all but one [Exp.1] / all [Exp.2] messages were congruent or incongruent to participants' attitudes) and endorsement of congruent messages by other users (congruent messages displayed higher or lower numbers of “likes” than incongruent messages). Additionally, based on Elaboration Likelihood Theory, interest in a topic was considered as a moderating variable. Both studies confirmed that participants infer public support for their own attitudes from the degree of agreement they encounter in online messages, yet are skeptical of the validity of “likes”, especially if their interest in a topic is high.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.5817/CP2021-1-3","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-07-28T15:11:06.111Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"bbcIsG7OSaSjJzoS0Wuz1A==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6101738ad112b71809959ba2"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"T6vWXu96S8eFEyizxNNK7w==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"Let’s Start from the Beginning: Understanding Audiences","authors":["Karen Sutherland"],"date":{"$date":"2021-07-28T00:00:00.000Z"},"pdf_url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-981-15-4658-7_3","abstract":"Semantic Scholar extracted view of ","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1007/978-981-15-4658-7_3","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-07-28T15:11:06.185Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"bbcIsG7OSaSjJzoS0Wuz1A==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6101738ad112b71809959ba3"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"/0vwDDwbRqyGd21rEYllpQ==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"Junk news bubbles modelling the rise and fall of attention in online arenas","authors":["Maria Castaldo","T.

In contrast to existing studies of such correlations we focus on attention to specific topics of different socio-demographic classes. Interests are represented by topics that can be assigned to user’s subscriptions. As a measure of involvement in topics, we analyse interests heterogeneity and determine the most influential factors, associated with particular interests. Topic modelling is performed by ARTM; user’s attention to interests is measured by Gini Index and then related to socio-demographic factors. To investigate the influence of features on specific topics we trained an interpretable regression model (XGBoost and SHAP) and built a corresponding graph with clusters to analyze the results. To investigate further we scattered topics according to their socio-demographic profile and coloured according to clusters. Results show that patterns of user’s attention differ depending on socio-demographical features. We notice a shift in attention depending on age, and different patterns of attention for genders. Topics connected to gender mostly have a male audience, while age is more influential among topics with mostly female and mostly age-homogeneous audiences. We also suggest ways that can be used to improve interest prediction.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1016/j.procs.2020.11.018","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-07-28T15:11:06.694Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"bbcIsG7OSaSjJzoS0Wuz1A==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6101738ad112b71809959ba5"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"o3pDfZ9PTo+WkC0cTNddSQ==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"Junk News Bubbles: Modelling the Rise and Fall of Attention in Online Arenas","authors":["Maria Castaldo","T.

Confirmation bias helps to account for users’ decisions about whether to spread content, thus creating informational cascades within identifiable communities. At the same time, aggregation of favored information within those communities reinforces selective exposure and group polarization. Along this path, through a thorough quantitative analysis we approach connectivity patterns of 1.2 M Facebook users engaged with two very conflicting narratives: scientific and conspiracy news. Analyzing such data, we quantitatively investigate the effect of two mechanisms (namely challenge avoidance and reinforcement seeking) behind confirmation bias, one of the major drivers of human behavior in social media. We find that challenge avoidance mechanism triggers the emergence of two distinct and polarized groups of users (i.e., echo chambers) who also tend to be surrounded by friends having similar systems of beliefs. Through a network based approach, we show how the reinforcement seeking mechanism limits the influence of neighbors and primarily drives the selection and diffusion of contents even among like-minded users, thus fostering the formation of highly polarized sub-clusters within the same echo chamber. Finally, we show that polarized users reinforce their preexisting beliefs by leveraging the activity of their like-minded neighbors, and this trend grows with the user engagement suggesting how peer influence acts as a support for reinforcement seeking.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1038/s41598-019-56191-7","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-07-28T15:11:15.221Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"bbcIsG7OSaSjJzoS0Wuz1A==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6101739ad112b71809959bac"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"P9qI1THwS4mnE3L1hVM3hg==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"A Model for the Influence of Media on the Ideology of Content in Online Social Networks","authors":["Heather Z.

This limitation has been empirically defined in the physical and social spaces. But do people exhibit similar constraints in the digital space? We address this question through the analysis of pseudonymised mobility and mobile application (app) usage data of 400,000 individuals in a European country for six months. Despite the enormous heterogeneity of apps usage, we find that individuals exhibit a conserved capacity that limits the number of applications they regularly use. Moreover, we find that this capacity steadily decreases with age, as does the capacity in the physical space but with more complex dynamics. Even though people might have the same capacity, applications get added and removed over time. In this respect, we identify two profiles of individuals: app keepers and explorers, which differ in their stable (keepers) vs exploratory (explorers) behaviour regarding their use of mobile applications. Finally, we show that the capacity of applications predicts mobility capacity and vice-versa. By contrast, the behaviour of keepers and explorers may considerably vary across the two domains. Our empirical findings provide an intriguing picture linking human behaviour in the physical and digital worlds which bridges research studies from Computer Science, Social Physics and Computational Social Sciences.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1038/s41598-019-47493-x","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-07-28T15:11:23.199Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"bbcIsG7OSaSjJzoS0Wuz1A==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6102bcead112b71809959bb4"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"UC6zb84mR7mQ+pom00FD6g==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"node2vec: Scalable Feature Learning for Networks","authors":["Grover, Aditya","Leskovec, Jure"],"date":{"$date":"2016-07-03T00:00:00.000Z"},"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1607.00653","abstract":" Prediction tasks over nodes and edges in networks require careful effort in\nengineering features used by learning algorithms.

The decentralized adaptive control is designed for each agent by using the information of its neighbors. Under the proposed decentralized adaptive controls, both rigid mathematical proof and simulation studies are provided to show that all the agents are guaranteed to reach their common goal, i.e., following the desired reference.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1109/IROS.2009.5354393","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-07-29T14:36:52.810Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"8gcG2OQzSPeKEafKtWZP4w==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6102bd04d112b71809959bbd"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"hZct4HJ8SBiTQt3s6dyH/A==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"Decentralized adaptive synchronization of a stochastic discrete-time multiagent dynamic model","authors":["Hong-Bin Ma"],"date":{"$date":"2009-07-29T00:00:00.000Z"},"pdf_url":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5400255","abstract":"A decentralized adaptive synchronization problem for a simple yet nontrivial discrete-time stochastic model of network dynamics is investigated, which also illustrates a general framework for a class of adaptive control problems for complex systems with uncertainties.

A virtual vehicle is constructed such that its trajectory converges to the reference trajectory of the follower. Position tracking control is designed for the follower to track the virtual vehicle using Lyapunov and backstepping synthesis.

Under mild assumptions about the degree of smoothness exhibited by the nonlinear functions, the algorithm is proven to be stable, with tracking errors converging to a neighborhood of zero. A constructive procedure is detailed, which directly translates the assumed smoothness properties of the nonlinearities involved into a specification of the network required to represent the plant to a chosen degree of accuracy. A stable weight adjustment mechanism is then determined using Lyapunov theory. The network construction and performance of the resulting controller are illustrated through simulations with an example system.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1109/72.165588","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-07-29T14:36:55.407Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"8gcG2OQzSPeKEafKtWZP4w==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6102bd07d112b71809959bce"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"Ac84P+1EQYiCOzjuzSl1TQ==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"Stable Adaptive Neural Network Control","authors":["S.

Both linearly parameterized and multi-layer neural networks (NN) are discussed and employed in the design of adaptive NN control systems for completeness. Stable adaptive NN control has been thoroughly investigated for several classes of nonlinear systems, including nonlinear systems in Brunovsky form, nonlinear systems in strict-feedback and pure-feedback forms, nonaffine nonlinear systems, and a class of MIMO nonlinear systems.

Therefore, there is no need for global information at all times, reducing the overall communication load.

An ISS-modular approach is presented by combining adaptive neural design with the backstepping method, input-to-state stability (ISS) analysis and the small-gain theorem. The difficulty in controlling the non-affine pure-feedback system is overcome by achieving the so-called “ISS-modularity” of the controller-estimator. Specifically, a neural controller is designed to achieve ISS for the state error subsystem with respect to the neural weight estimation errors, and a neural weight estimator is designed to achieve ISS for the weight estimation subsystem with respect to the system state errors. The stability of the entire closed-loop system is guaranteed by the small-gain theorem. The ISS-modular approach provides an effective way for controlling non-affine non-linear systems.

This is a formal approach to extraction of interaction rules that lead to the emergence of collective behavior. We show that the first algorithm generically leads to regular fragmentation, whereas the second and third algorithms both lead to flocking.

The NN is adopted to approximate the complex AUV hydrodynamics and differential of desired tracking velocities. The bound of the generalized disturbance, which is composed of NN approximation error and ocean disturbances, are approximated based on the adaptive estimation technique.

Subsequently, only the robot joint is measurable in practice; output feedback control is designed with a high-gain observer to estimate unmeasurable states. Through the Lyapunov stability analysis, system stability is achieved with the proposed control, and the system output achieves convergence without violation of the joint constraints. Simulation is conducted to approve the feasibility and superiority of the proposed NN control.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1109/TNNLS.2018.2803827","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-07-29T14:37:16.512Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"8gcG2OQzSPeKEafKtWZP4w==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6102bd1cd112b71809959bfd"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"1cSu9IXIR7KBzccmjho70g==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"Active Vibration Control and Stability Analysis of Flexible Beam Systems","authors":["W.

The controller is fully independent of the DG parameters. Therefore, the controller can be deployed on any DG regardless of the DG parameters and the connector specifications, and its performance does not deteriorate by the change in DG parameters (e.g., due to aging and thermal effects).

The multiple dynamic leaders are neighbors of only a subset of the followers described by completely non-affine multi-input multi-output pure-feedback dynamics. It is assumed that all followers' nonlinearities are heterogeneous and unknown. The proposed containment controller is implemented by using only error surfaces integrated by performance bounding functions and does not require any differential equations for compensating uncertainties and faults. Thus, compared with the previous containment control approaches for multi-agent systems with unknown non-affine nonlinearities, the distributed containment control structure is simplified. In addition, it is shown that the proposed control scheme can be applied to the fault-tolerant containment control problem in the presence of unexpected system and actuator faults, without reconstructing any control structure. It is shown from Lyapunov stability theorem that all followers nearly converge to the dynamic convex hull spanned by the dynamic leaders and the containment control errors are preserved within certain given predefined bounds.

The objective is to control a group of agents to track a desired trajectory while maintaining a given formation in nonomniscient constrained space. Aiming at this purpose, the average of all agents' positions is viewed as the virtual leader, and the task is translated into that controlling the virtual leader to track the center of the desired formation. The situation where agents may not have global environmental information will lead to that they may have to avoid collisions with unexpected spatial constraints. By introducing the concepts of line source and surface source, two main types of spatial constraints: 1) borders and 2) obstacles are defined mathematically and unified into a common expression in an artificial potential function. In this way, the tasks of formation tracking and obstacle avoidance in a bounded environment can be solved by the control law proposed in this paper. Furthermore, concerning the situation of multiple spatial constraints, a Dirac delta function is introduced. Meanwhile, a formation optimal algorithm is proposed to minimize the formation generation time cost. Following that, a controller is designed, and the conditions for asymptotic stability of multiagent systems are proved based on the Lyapunov function. The maximum duration that the conditions cannot be satisfied is elaborated to indicate whether the tracking task should be given up. Meanwhile, the impulsive influence from spatial constraints is analyzed.

First, a constrained dynamic model of biped robots and a reduced order dynamical model for the double-support phase are formulated. Considering the dynamic external wrench applied on biped robots, we present a dynamic force distribution approach based on quadratic objective function for computing the optimal contact forces to equilibrate the dynamic external wrench. As a result, the sum of the normal force components is minimized for enhancing safety and energy saving. Then, one primary recurrent neural network (RNN) is adopted to solve the optimization problem subject to both equality and inequality constraints. For the derived optimized contact force and motion, hybrid motion/force control is proposed based on another RNN to approximate unknown dynamic functions. Adaptive learning algorithms for learning the parameters of the RNN are provided as well. The proposed control can deal with the uncertainties including approximation errors and external disturbances.

For pragmatic use and validation, we carry out a marketing campaign that shows a threefold increase in response rate by targeting individuals identified by our social network metrics as compared to random targeting. Our strategy can also be useful in maximizing the effects of large-scale economic stimulus policies. It is believed that patterns of social ties are related to individuals’ financial status.

The approximation makes feasible an efficient estimation of\nthe redundancy of data along with the related experimental information and\ninformation cost function. From the experimental information the complexity of\nthe phenomenon can be simply estimated, while the proper number of experiments\nneeded for its exploration can be determined from the minimum of the cost\nfunction. The performance of the approximate estimation of these statistics is\ndemonstrated on two-dimensional normally distributed random data.\n","arxiv_id":"0704.0162","doi":null,"journal_title":null},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-07-29T14:59:19.754Z"},"cited_articles":[]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6102c248d112b71809959c46"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"wgXGeMpzRDW79Y29j/AQeg==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"Robust manipulation of electron spin coherence in an ensemble of singly charged quantum dots","authors":["Greilich, A.","Wiemann, M.","Hernandez, F.

With beamforming RVQ is asymptotically optimal,\ni.e., no other quantization scheme can achieve a larger asymptotic rate. The\nperformance of RVQ is also compared with that of a simpler reduced-rank scalar\nquantization scheme in which the beamformer is constrained to lie in a random\nsubspace.

The basic principle behind this approach is called the\nflip. In essence, it reduces the negative hypothesis in complexity theory (the\nlower bound problems), such as the P vs. NP problem in characteristic zero, to\nthe positive hypothesis in complexity theory (the upper bound problems):\nspecifically, to showing that the problems of deciding nonvanishing of the\nfundamental structural constants in representation theory and algebraic\ngeometry, such as the well known plethysm constants--or rather certain relaxed\nforms of these decision probelms--belong to the complexity class P. In this\narticle, we suggest a plan for implementing the flip, i.e., for showing that\nthese relaxed decision problems belong to P. This is based on the reduction of\nthe preceding complexity-theoretic positive hypotheses to mathematical\npositivity hypotheses: specifically, to showing that there exist positive\nformulae--i.e. formulae with nonnegative coefficients--for the structural\nconstants under consideration and certain functions associated with them. These\nturn out be intimately related to the similar positivity properties of the\nKazhdan-Lusztig polynomials and the multiplicative structural constants of the\ncanonical (global crystal) bases in the theory of Drinfeld-Jimbo quantum\ngroups. The known proofs of these positivity properties depend on the Riemann\nhypothesis over finite fields and the related results.

However, even if the monotonicity in\nthe empirical distribution is violated, diminishing per symbol individual\nsequence redundancies with respect to the monotonic maximum likelihood\ndescription length may still be achievable.\n","arxiv_id":"0704.0838","doi":null,"journal_title":null},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-07-29T15:00:24.820Z"},"cited_articles":[]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6102c289d112b71809959c91"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"FL7RttOVQnKgqPf1svecwA==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"Semi-spheroidal Quantum Harmonic Oscillator","authors":["Poenaru, D.

In a MIMO-based mesh network, the links outgoing from each\nnode sharing the common communication spectrum can be modeled as a Gaussian\nvector broadcast channel. Recently, researchers showed that ``dirty paper\ncoding'' (DPC) is the optimal transmission strategy for Gaussian vector\nbroadcast channels. So far, there has been little study on how this fundamental\nresult will impact the cross-layer design for MIMO-based mesh networks. To fill\nthis gap, we consider the problem of jointly optimizing DPC power allocation in\nthe link layer at each node and multihop/multipath routing in a MIMO-based mesh\nnetworks. It turns out that this optimization problem is a very challenging\nnon-convex problem.

If\nthe emitter moves away from us, a redshift is observed. If the emitter moves\ntowards us, whether a redshift, a blueshift or no shift is observed will depend\non the speed vs. the distance.

In both cases the response of the lithosphere to external\nforces can be calculated with the theory of thin elastic plates or shells. On\none-plate planets the spherical geometry of the lithospheric shell plays an\nimportant role in the flexure mechanism. So far the equations governing the\ndeformations and stresses of a spherical shell have only been derived under the\nassumption of a shell of constant thickness. However local studies of gravity\nand topography data suggest large variations in the thickness of the\nlithosphere. In this article we obtain the scalar flexure equations governing\nthe deformations of a thin spherical shell with variable thickness or variable\nYoung's modulus. The resulting equations can be solved in succession, except\nfor a system of two simultaneous equations, the solutions of which are the\ntransverse deflection and an associated stress function. In order to include\nbottom loading generated by mantle convection, we extend the method of stress\nfunctions to include loads with a toroidal tangential component. We further\nshow that toroidal tangential displacement always occurs if the shell thickness\nvaries, even in the absence of toroidal loads. We finally prove that the\ndegree-one harmonic components of the transverse deflection and of the toroidal\ntangential displacement are independent of the elastic properties of the shell\nand are associated with translational and rotational freedom.

Functionally\nsimilar proteins can differ substantially in their robustness to mutations and\ncapacity to evolve new functions, but it has remained unclear whether any of\nthese differences might be due to evolutionary selection for these properties. RESULTS: Here we use laboratory experiments to demonstrate that evolution\nfavors protein mutational robustness if the evolving population is sufficiently\nlarge. We neutrally evolve cytochrome P450 proteins under identical selection\npressures and mutation rates in populations of different sizes, and show that\nproteins from the larger and thus more polymorphic population tend towards\nhigher mutational robustness. Proteins from the larger population also evolve\ngreater stability, a biophysical property that is known to enhance both\nmutational robustness and evolvability. The excess mutational robustness and\nstability is well described by existing mathematical theories, and can be\nquantitatively related to the way that the proteins occupy their neutral\nnetwork. CONCLUSIONS: Our work is the first experimental demonstration of the general\ntendency of evolution to favor mutational robustness and protein stability in\nhighly polymorphic populations. We suggest that this phenomenon may contribute\nto the mutational robustness and evolvability of viruses and bacteria that\nexist in large populations.\n","arxiv_id":"0704.1885","doi":"10.1186/1741-7007-5-29","journal_title":null},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-07-29T15:02:01.793Z"},"cited_articles":[]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6102c2ead112b71809959d0c"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"2YdkHB5TR+mgn5yuNqb+Mg==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"Computation and visualization of Casimir forces in arbitrary geometries: non-monotonic lateral forces and failure of proximity-force approximations","authors":["Rodriguez, Alejandro","Ibanescu, Mihai","Iannuzzi, Davide","Capasso, Federico","Joannopoulos, John D.","Johnson, Steven G."],"date":{"$date":"2007-04-15T00:00:00.000Z"},"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/0704.1890","abstract":" We present a method of computing Casimir forces for arbitrary geometries,\nwith any desired accuracy, that can directly exploit the efficiency of standard\nnumerical-electromagnetism techniques.

This allows sufficient separation of scales to\nobserve a Navier-Stokes (NS) inertial range followed by a 2nd LANS inertial\nrange. The analysis of the third-order structure function scaling supports the\npredicted l^3 scaling; it corresponds to a k^(-1) scaling of the energy\nspectrum. The energy spectrum itself shows a different scaling which goes as\nk^1. This latter spectrum is consistent with the absence of stretching in the\nsub-filter scales due to the Taylor frozen-in hypothesis employed as a closure\nin the derivation of LANS. These two scalings are conjectured to coexist in\ndifferent spatial portions of the flow. The l^3 (E(k) k^(-1)) scaling is\nsubdominant to k^1 in the energy spectrum, but the l^3 scaling is responsible\nfor the direct energy cascade, as no cascade can result from motions with no\ninternal degrees of freedom. We verify the prediction for the size of the LANS\nattractor resulting from this scaling.

Quite\ninterestingly, this noisy feedback model is shown to be more advantageous in\nthe current setting.

Rather than a blessing, this feature is treated more as\nan interference-inducing nuisance in most wireless networks today (e.g., IEEE\n802.11). This paper shows that the concept of network coding can be applied at\nthe physical layer to turn the broadcast property into a capacity-boosting\nadvantage in wireless ad hoc networks. Specifically, we propose a\nphysical-layer network coding (PNC) scheme to coordinate transmissions among\nnodes. In contrast to straightforward network coding which performs coding\narithmetic on digital bit streams after they have been received, PNC makes use\nof the additive nature of simultaneously arriving electromagnetic (EM) waves\nfor equivalent coding operation. And in doing so, PNC can potentially achieve\n100% and 50% throughput increases compared with traditional transmission and\nstraightforward network coding, respectively, in multi-hop networks. More\nspecifically, the information-theoretic capacity of PNC is almost double that\nof traditional transmission in the SNR region of practical interest (higher\nthan 0dB).

It does not require long-distance freshwater transportation. If seawater\nis not utilized for increasing its productivity, this inexpensive new method is\nvery environment-friendly. The author method has two working versions: (1) the\nfirst variant the warm (hot) atmospheric air is lifted by the inflatable tube\nin a high altitude and atmospheric steam is condenced into freswater: (2) in\nthe second version, the warm air is pumped 20-30 meters under the sea-surface.\nIn the first version, wind and solar heating of air are used for causing air\nflow.

We have deployed Grale in more than 20 different industrial\nsettings at Google, including datasets which have tens of billions of nodes,\nand hundreds of trillions of potential edges to score. By employing locality\nsensitive hashing techniques,we greatly reduce the number of pairs that need to\nbe scored, allowing us to learn a task specific model and build the associated\nnearest neighbor graph for such datasets in hours, rather than the days or even\nweeks that might be required otherwise. We illustrate this through a case study\nwhere we examine the application of Grale to an abuse classification problem on\nYouTube with hundreds of million of items. In this application, we find that\nGrale detects a large number of malicious actors on top of hard-coded rules and\ncontent classifiers, increasing the total recall by 89% over those approaches\nalone.\n","arxiv_id":"2007.12002","doi":"10.1145/3394486.3403302","journal_title":null},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-07-29T22:23:29.480Z"},"cited_articles":[]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6104117cecc93e6fb1f6bf8b"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"R4/XnWnHRK+87EdmF1B1IA==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"baller2vec: A Multi-Entity Transformer For Multi-Agent Spatiotemporal Modeling","authors":["Alcorn, Michael A.","Nguyen, Anh"],"date":{"$date":"2021-02-05T00:00:00.000Z"},"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.03291","abstract":" Multi-agent spatiotemporal modeling is a challenging task from both an\nalgorithmic design and computational complexity perspective.

In particular, we consider both the original Transformer Network (TF) and the larger Bidirectional Transformer (BERT), state-of-the-art on all natural language processing tasks. Our proposed Transformers predict the trajectories of the individual people in the scene.

In particular, the TF model without bells and whistles yields the best score on the largest and most challenging trajectory forecasting benchmark of TrajNet [1]. Additionally, its extension which predicts multiple plausible future trajectories performs on par with more engineered techniques on the 5 datasets of ETH [2]+UCY [3].

Yet, the relevance between sequence prediction and imputation is disregarded by existing approaches. To this end, we propose a novel imitative non-autoregressive modeling method to simultaneously handle the trajectory prediction task and the missing value imputation task. Specifically, our framework adopts an imitation learning paradigm, which contains a recurrent conditional variational autoencoder (RC-VAE) as a demonstrator, and a non-autoregressive transformation model (NART) as a learner. By jointly optimizing the two models, RC-VAE can predict the future trajectory and capture the temporal relationship in the sequence to supervise the NART learner. As a result, NART learns from the demonstrator and imputes the missing value in a non autoregressive strategy. We conduct extensive experiments on three popular datasets, and the results show that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance across all the datasets.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1109/CVPR42600.2020.01275","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-07-30T14:49:57.890Z"},"cited_articles":[]},{"_id":{"$oid":"61041196ecc93e6fb1f6bf91"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"bdXTTNMRQ0GNZuWoYCRq0Q==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"Motion fields to predict play evolution in dynamic sport scenes","authors":["Kihwan Kim","Matthias Grundmann","Ariel Shamir","I.

Such analysis requires estimating the global movements of all players in the scene at any time, and is needed for modeling and predicting how the multi-agent play evolves over time on the field.

We start by extracting the ground level sparse movement of players in each time-step, and then generate a dense motion field. Using this field we detect locations where the motion converges, implying positions towards which the play is evolving.

Using deep reinforcement learning to train general purpose neural network policies alleviates some of the burden of manual representation engineering by using expressive policy classes, but exacerbates the challenge of data collection, since such methods tend to be less efficient than RL with low-dimensional, hand-designed representations. Transfer learning can mitigate this problem by enabling us to transfer information from one skill to another and even from one robot to another. We show that neural network policies can be decomposed into “task-specific” and “robot-specific” modules, where the task-specific modules are shared across robots, and the robot-specific modules are shared across all tasks on that robot. This allows for sharing task information, such as perception, between robots and sharing robot information, such as dynamics and kinematics, between tasks. We exploit this decomposition to train mix-and-match modules that can solve new robot-task combinations that were not seen during training.

While there have been attempts to train robots using trial-and-error experiments, the amount of data used in such experiments remains substantially low and hence makes the learner prone to over-fitting. In this paper, we take the leap of increasing the available training data to 40 times more than prior work, leading to a dataset size of 50K data points collected over 700 hours of robot grasping attempts. This allows us to train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for the task of predicting grasp locations without severe overfitting. In our formulation, we recast the regression problem to an 18-way binary classification over image patches. We also present a multi-stage learning approach where a CNN trained in one stage is used to collect hard negatives in subsequent stages.

These large-scale engineering contributions enable us to answer scientific questions requiring experiments that were till now impracticable or 'merely' impractical. Specifically, in the context of point-goal navigation: (1) we revisit the comparison between learning and SLAM approaches from two recent works and find evidence for the opposite conclusion -- that learning outperforms SLAM if scaled to an order of magnitude more experience than previous investigations, and (2) we conduct the first cross-dataset generalization experiments {train, test} x {Matterport3D, Gibson} for multiple sensors {blind, RGB, RGBD, D} and find that only agents with depth (D) sensors generalize across datasets.

This suggests that the gap between unsupervised and supervised representation learning has been largely closed in many vision tasks.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1109/cvpr42600.2020.00975","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-08-01T09:52:55.492Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"k+Cvf4KJQIqn4FH52o8taQ==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6107ae96ecc93e6fb1f6bfab"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"is5Ld28hSMGZtIzAhHw/mA==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"To join or not to join: the illusion of privacy in social networks with mixed public and private user profiles","authors":["Elena Zheleva","Lise Getoor"],"date":{"$date":"2009-04-20T00:00:00.000Z"},"pdf_url":"https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1526709.1526781","abstract":"In order to address privacy concerns, many social media websites allow users to hide their personal profiles from the public.

The key novel idea is that in addition to friendship links, groups can be carriers of significant information. We show that on several well-known social media sites, we can easily and accurately recover the information of private-profile users.

Therefore, an accurate classifier is an essential component of a hypertext database. Hyperlinks pose new problems not addressed in the extensive text classification literature. Links clearly contain high-quality semantic clues that are lost upon a purely term-based classifier, but exploiting link information is non-trivial because it is noisy. Naive use of terms in the link neighborhood of a document can even degrade accuracy. Our contribution is to propose robust statistical models and a relaxation labeling technique for better classification by exploiting link information in a small neighborhood around documents. Our technique also adapts gracefully to the fraction of neighboring documents having known topics. We experimented with pre-classified samples from Yahoo!1 and the US Patent Database2. In previous work, we developed a text classifier that misclassified only 13% of the documents in the well-known Reuters benchmark; this was comparable to the best results ever obtained. This classifier misclassified 36% of the patents, indicating that classifying hypertext can be more difficult than classifying text. Naively using terms in neighboring documents increased error to 38%; our hypertext classifier reduced it to 21%. Results with the Yahoo! sample were more dramatic: the text classifier showed 68% error, whereas our hypertext classifier reduced this to only 21%.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1145/276305.276332","journal_title":null},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-08-02T08:38:03.629Z"},"cited_articles":[]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6107af17ecc93e6fb1f6bfe3"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"qxReDZ0bSzuQMrZKip4ozQ==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"Relational learning via latent social dimensions","authors":["Lei Tang","Huan Liu"],"date":{"$date":"2009-06-28T00:00:00.000Z"},"pdf_url":"https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/1557019.1557109","abstract":"Social media such as blogs, Facebook, Flickr, etc., presents data in a network format rather than classical IID distribution. To address the interdependency among data instances, relational learning has been proposed, and collective inference based on network connectivity is adopted for prediction. However, connections in social media are often multi-dimensional. An actor can connect to another actor for different reasons, e.g., alumni, colleagues, living in the same city, sharing similar interests, etc. Collective inference normally does not differentiate these connections. In this work, we propose to extract latent social dimensions based on network information, and then utilize them as features for discriminative learning. These social dimensions describe diverse affiliations of actors hidden in the network, and the discriminative learning can automatically determine which affiliations are better aligned with the class labels. Such a scheme is preferred when multiple diverse relations are associated with the same network. We conduct extensive experiments on social media data (one from a real-world blog site and the other from a popular content sharing site). Our model outperforms representative relational learning methods based on collective inference, especially when few labeled data are available. The sensitivity of this model and its connection to existing methods are also examined.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1145/1557019.1557109","journal_title":null},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-08-02T08:38:47.197Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"TL/sEc3NR56EJMBpsiw6rg==","$type":"4"}],"related_articles_were_imported":true},{"_id":{"$oid":"6107af2eecc93e6fb1f6bfe9"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"FJjcCFk+T3uz8u5IL3LosQ==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"A streaming ensemble algorithm (SEA) for large-scale classification","authors":["W.

For example, in hypertext classification, the labels of linked pages are highly correlated. A standard approach is to classify each entity independently, ignoring the correlations between them. Recently, Probabilistic Relational Models, a relational version of Bayesian networks, were used to define a joint probabilistic model for a collection of related entities. In this paper, we present an alternative framework that builds on (conditional) Markov networks and addresses two limitations of the previous approach. First, undirected models do not impose the acyclicity constraint that hinders representation of many important relational dependencies in directed models. Second, undirected models are well suited for discriminative training, where we optimize the conditional likelihood of the labels given the features, which generally improves classification accuracy. We show how to train these models effectively, and how to use approximate probabilistic inference over the learned model for collective classification of multiple related entities. We provide experimental results on a webpage classification task, showing that accuracy can be significantly improved by modeling relational dependencies.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.5555/2073876.2073934","journal_title":null},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-08-02T08:39:59.046Z"},"cited_articles":[]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6107d1d7942a4b6254576fef"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"3FFnQ8NBQgGeuRI8LN1nKg==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"On the structure of the group of Lipschitz homeomorphisms and its subgroups, II : Dedicated to Professor Hideki Imanishi on his 60th birthday","authors":["Kōjun Abe","K.

This paper proposes and evaluates an optimization algorithm for the powerful de-identification procedure known as k-anonymization. A k-anonymized dataset has the property that each record is indistinguishable from at least k - 1 others. Even simple restrictions of optimized k-anonymity are NP-hard, leading to significant computational challenges. We present a new approach to exploring the space of possible anonymizations that tames the combinatorics of the problem, and develop data-management strategies to reduce reliance on expensive operations such as sorting. Through experiments on real census data, we show the resulting algorithm can find optimal k-anonymizations under two representative cost measures and a wide range of k. We also show that the algorithm can produce good anonymizations in circumstances where the input data or input parameters preclude finding an optimal solution in reasonable time. Finally, we use the algorithm to explore the effects of different coding approaches and problem variations on anonymization quality and performance. To our knowledge, this is the first result demonstrating optimal k-anonymization of a non-trivial dataset under a general model of the problem.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1109/ICDE.2005.42","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"related_articles_were_imported":false,"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-08-02T11:21:59.161Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"i3jn3CmpT4eEMaqYlgs5yg==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"EKkY4oXFQQmEdZXF/SjKlQ==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6107d557942a4b6254576ffa"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"LL5jGrAsTc6YPqvcNgxGCA==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"Introduction to Statistical Relational Learning","authors":["Charles Sutton","A.

Contrary to intuition, a variant of the result threatens the privacy even of someone not in the database. This state of affairs suggests a new measure, differential privacy, which, intuitively, captures the increased risk to one's privacy incurred by participating in a database.

After surveying prior work, we present NetKit, a modular toolkit for classification in networked data, and a case-study of its application to networked data used in prior machine learning research. NetKit is based on a node-centric framework in which classifiers comprise a local classifier, a relational classifier, and a collective inference procedure. Various existing node-centric relational learning algorithms can be instantiated with appropriate choices for these components, and new combinations of components realize new algorithms. The case study focuses on univariate network classification, for which the only information used is the structure of class linkage in the network (i.e., only links and some class labels). To our knowledge, no work previously has evaluated systematically the power of class-linkage alone for classification in machine learning benchmark data sets. The results demonstrate that very simple network-classification models perform quite well---well enough that they should be used regularly as baseline classifiers for studies of learning with networked data. The simplest method (which performs remarkably well) highlights the close correspondence between several existing methods introduced for different purposes---that is, Gaussian-field classifiers, Hopfield networks, and relational-neighbor classifiers. The case study also shows that there are two sets of techniques that are preferable in different situations, namely when few versus many labels are known initially. We also demonstrate that link selection plays an important role similar to traditional feature selection.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.21236/ada443847","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"related_articles_were_imported":false,"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-08-02T11:22:00.784Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"qxReDZ0bSzuQMrZKip4ozQ==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"+NW2To6nTv6KO4OL4R6S/A==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"2HY2gwRXSZu23PQVUHWjYA==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"7bHz+Gq2Sem7JZ+a7bVEYQ==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"GKsuXxLXQbmJNJhzFxJ0+A==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6107d558942a4b6254577004"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"Htm6YXhJTAiBO/f2ArNw7A==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"Not All Features Are Equal: Discovering Essential Features for Preserving Prediction Privacy","authors":["FatemehSadat Mireshghallah","Mohammadkazem Taram","A.

Discerning this subset is the key problem of this work. We formulate this problem as a gradient-based perturbation maximization method that discovers this subset in the input feature space with respect to the functionality of the prediction model used by the provider. After identifying the subset, our framework, Cloak, suppresses the rest of the features using utility-preserving constant values that are discovered through a separate gradient-based optimization process. We show that Cloak does not necessarily require collaboration from the service provider beyond its normal service, and can be applied in scenarios where we only have black-box access to the service provider’s model. We theoretically guarantee that Cloak’s optimizations reduce the upper bound of the Mutual Information (MI) between the data and the sifted representations that are sent out. Experimental results show that Cloak reduces the mutual information between the input and the sifted representations by 85.01% with only negligible reduction in utility (1.42%). In addition, we show that Cloak greatly diminishes adversaries’ ability to learn and infer non-conducive features.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1145/3442381.3449965","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"related_articles_were_imported":true,"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-08-02T11:22:00.883Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"is5Ld28hSMGZtIzAhHw/mA==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6107d558942a4b6254577005"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"ZUoxWxdBQ76wZXQoFj42gA==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"Wherefore art thou R3579X?: anonymized social networks, hidden patterns, and structural steganography","authors":["L.

Such a model provides information about the “attractiveness” and “expansiveness” of the individual nodes in the network, as well as the tendency of a pair of nodes to reciprocate relational ties. When the nodes are a priori partitioned into subgroups based on attributes such as race and sex, the density of ties from one subgroup to another can differ considerably from that relating another pair of subgroups, thus creating a situation called blocking in social networks. The p 1 model completely ignores this extra piece of information and is, therefore, unable to explain the block structure. Blockmodels that are simple extensions of the p 1 model are proposed specifically for such data. An iterative scaling algorithm is presented for fitting the model parameters by maximum likelihood. The methodology is illustrated in detail on two empirical examples.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1080/01621459.1987.10478385","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"related_articles_were_imported":false,"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-08-02T11:22:01.413Z"},"cited_articles":[]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6107d559942a4b6254577009"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"iHFMcifDQ/OeedvLHSmzWQ==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"Toward integrating feature selection algorithms for classification and clustering","authors":["H.

The approach guarantees anonymity for network entities while preserving the ability to estimate a wide variety of network measures with relatively little bias.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.14778/1453856.1453873","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"related_articles_were_imported":true,"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-08-02T11:22:02.331Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"is5Ld28hSMGZtIzAhHw/mA==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"ZUoxWxdBQ76wZXQoFj42gA==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"fz1bbWfxS4yDweiWu1EtjA==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"0N3VmiEnQTWPWzOnD9BCow==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"2OQ5PnDXSPSTk8xPYfv83Q==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"+44FC39RT9ivvrbp+BWqGA==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6107d55a942a4b625457700e"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"aYmAgE51QiGNbdqBBEyhfg==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"Collective Classification in Network Data","authors":["P.

The structure of the graph itself, and in its basic form the degree of the nodes, can be revealing the identities of individuals. To address this issue, we study a specific graph-anonymization problem. We call a graph k-degree anonymous if for every node v, there exist at least k-1 other nodes in the graph with the same degree as v. This definition of anonymity prevents the re-identification of individuals by adversaries with a priori knowledge of the degree of certain nodes. We formally define the graph-anonymization problem that, given a graph G, asks for the k-degree anonymous graph that stems from G with the minimum number of graph-modification operations. We devise simple and efficient algorithms for solving this problem. Our algorithms are based on principles related to the realizability of degree sequences. We apply our methods to a large spectrum of synthetic and real datasets and demonstrate their efficiency and practical utility.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1145/1376616.1376629","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"related_articles_were_imported":true,"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-08-02T11:22:02.620Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"i3jn3CmpT4eEMaqYlgs5yg==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"dQ01eAbmQCOzw9UTJo5r8Q==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"w/gzb4Z+RiGpV2mhzoDqbQ==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"is5Ld28hSMGZtIzAhHw/mA==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"fz1bbWfxS4yDweiWu1EtjA==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"0N3VmiEnQTWPWzOnD9BCow==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"xlWgWPliQlaj5iSLFaODpg==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"VvPRe9QeS/GeUg7DLVuPaA==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"fcDz2EDHRIeEGCLwndlqdg==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"ttqOQkzXTu+Hbl1eg77xxA==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"Waj76GBxRNiNLDKaM+6TRg==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"+44FC39RT9ivvrbp+BWqGA==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"PdfFtuLqTPqpMgFGSHCOYA==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"xOKv3XJbSNOlYiUG3kcayA==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"DkrAeDyISluh85ccV6OWUA==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"KhZtUXqYQc6kOMKSYyLPpg==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"eJy0/3GRRriSVvWZdlzYEA==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6107d55a942a4b6254577010"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"FrZRFJGBRvemZWheGVB8Qw==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"Mixed Membership Stochastic Blockmodels","authors":["E.

The findings suggest that opinion changes correspond more to a resorting of party labels among voters than to greater constraint on issue attitudes: since parties are more polarized, they are now better at sorting individuals along ideological lines. Levels of constraint vary across population subgroups: strong partisans and wealthier and politically sophisticated voters have grown more coherent in their beliefs.

One way to achieve this is to have the released records adhere to k- anonymity, which means each released record has at least (k-1) other records in the release whose values are indistinct over those fields that appear in external data. So, k- anonymity provides privacy protection by guaranteeing that each released record will relate to at least k individuals even if the records are directly linked to external information. This paper provides a formal presentation of combining generalization and suppression to achieve k-anonymity. Generalization involves replacing (or recoding) a value with a less specific but semantically consistent value. Suppression involves not releasing a value at all. The Preferred Minimal Generalization Algorithm (MinGen), which is a theoretical algorithm presented herein, combines these techniques to provide k-anonymity protection with minimal distortion. The real-world algorithms Datafly and µ-Argus are compared to MinGen. Both Datafly and µ-Argus use heuristics to make approximations, and so, they do not always yield optimal results. It is shown that Datafly can over distort data and µ-Argus can additionally fail to provide adequate protection.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1142/S021848850200165X","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"related_articles_were_imported":false,"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-08-02T11:22:03.179Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"MMTThV21QrqJlVds3npFSg==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"i3jn3CmpT4eEMaqYlgs5yg==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"xlWgWPliQlaj5iSLFaODpg==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"gJv0ITk/Sbqbm1z09mBnZA==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"W7GE35yfRBqc4htoD5YnEg==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"TCjFHw9nTsOYdNJmpPwa2A==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6107d55b942a4b6254577014"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"jj3iV3OdQ56xAJJGXsJPqg==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"Robust De-anonymization of Large Sparse Datasets","authors":["A.

The eye does not bring these two essential tasks together yet. Imagine an adversary can utilize the powerful GNNs to infer users’ private labels in a social network. How can we adversarially defend against such privacy attacks while maintaining the utility of perturbed graphs? In this work, we propose a novel research task, adversarial defenses against GNN-based privacy attacks, and present a graph perturbation-based approach, NetFense, to achieve the goal. NetFense can simultaneously keep graph data unnoticeability (i.e., having limited changes on the graph structure), maintain the prediction confidence of targeted label classification (i.e., preserving data utility), and reduce the prediction confidence of private label classification (i.e., protecting the privacy of nodes). Experiments conducted on singleand multiple-target perturbations using three real graph data exhibit that the perturbed graphs by NetFense can effectively maintain data utility (i.e., model unnoticeability) on targeted label classification and significantly decrease the prediction confidence of private label classification (i.e., privacy protection). Extensive studies also bring several insights, such as the flexibility of NetFense, preserving local neighborhoods in data unnoticeability, and better privacy protection for high-degree nodes.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1109/TKDE.2021.3087515","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"related_articles_were_imported":false,"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-08-02T11:22:21.553Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"is5Ld28hSMGZtIzAhHw/mA==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6107d56d942a4b6254577017"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"0TgGbLQ9RIS0uDoGijwUKw==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"Limit your body area -a COVID-19 mass radicalisation challenging autonomy and basic human rights","authors":["S.

Predicting node attributes in such graphs is an important task with applications in many domains like recommendation systems, privacy preservation, and targeted advertisement. Attribute values can be predicted by treating each node as a data point described by attributes and employing classification/regression algorithms. However, in social networks, there is complex interdependence between node attributes and pairwise interaction. For instance, attributes of nodes are influenced by their neighbors (social influence), and neighborhoods (friendships) between nodes are established based on pairwise (dis)similarity between their attributes (social selection). In this article, we establish that information in network topology is extremely useful in determining node attributes. In particular, we use self- and cross-proclivity measures (quantitative measures of how much a node attribute depends on the same and other attributes of its neighbors) to predict node attributes. We propose a feature map to represent a node with respect to a specific attribute a, using all attributes of its h-hop neighbors. Different classifiers are then learned on these feature vectors to predict the value of attribute a. We perform extensive experimentation on 10 real-world datasets and show that the proposed method significantly outperforms known approaches in terms of prediction accuracy.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1145/3442390","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"related_articles_were_imported":true,"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-08-02T11:22:22.174Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"is5Ld28hSMGZtIzAhHw/mA==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6107d56e942a4b6254577019"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"myGNp2T5S1Cjc+t7skpBCg==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"Methods for Social Media Monitoring Related to Vaccination: Systematic Scoping Review","authors":["E.

Although vaccine skepticism is not new, social media has amplified public concerns and facilitated their spread globally. Multiple studies have been conducted to monitor vaccination discussions on social media. However, there is currently insufficient evidence on the best methods to perform social media monitoring. Objective The aim of this study was to identify the methods most commonly used for monitoring vaccination-related topics on different social media platforms, along with their effectiveness and limitations. Methods A systematic scoping review was conducted by applying a comprehensive search strategy to multiple databases in December 2018. The articles’ titles, abstracts, and full texts were screened by two reviewers using inclusion and exclusion criteria. After data extraction, a descriptive analysis was performed to summarize the methods used to monitor and analyze social media, including data extraction tools; ethical considerations; search strategies; periods monitored; geolocalization of content; and sentiments, content, and reach analyses. Results This review identified 86 articles on social media monitoring of vaccination, most of which were published after 2015. Although 35 out of the 86 studies used manual browser search tools to collect data from social media, this was time-consuming and only allowed for the analysis of small samples compared to social media application program interfaces or automated monitoring tools. Although simple search strategies were considered less precise, only 10 out of the 86 studies used comprehensive lists of keywords (eg, with hashtags or words related to specific events or concerns). Partly due to privacy settings, geolocalization of data was extremely difficult to obtain, limiting the possibility of performing country-specific analyses. Finally, 20 out of the 86 studies performed trend or content analyses, whereas most of the studies (70%, 60/86) analyzed sentiments toward vaccination. Automated sentiment analyses, performed using leverage, supervised machine learning, or automated software, were fast and provided strong and accurate results. Most studies focused on negative (n=33) and positive (n=31) sentiments toward vaccination, and may have failed to capture the nuances and complexity of emotions around vaccination. Finally, 49 out of the 86 studies determined the reach of social media posts by looking at numbers of followers and engagement (eg, retweets, shares, likes). Conclusions Social media monitoring still constitutes a new means to research and understand public sentiments around vaccination. A wide range of methods are currently used by researchers. Future research should focus on evaluating these methods to offer more evidence and support the development of social media monitoring as a valuable research design.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.2196/17149","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"related_articles_were_imported":false,"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-08-02T11:22:22.537Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"is5Ld28hSMGZtIzAhHw/mA==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6107d56e942a4b625457701a"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"qyuD3eLhRwu2u8fwt3A9Gw==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"Facebook Tells Me Your Gender: An Exploratory Study of Gender Prediction for Turkish Facebook Users","authors":["ÇobanÖnder","İnanAli","ÖzelSelma Ayşe"],"date":{"$date":"2021-08-02T00:00:00.000Z"},"pdf_url":"https://doi.org/10.1145/3448253","abstract":"Online Social Networks (OSNs) are very popular platforms for social interaction.

Even if users conceal their sensitive information, attackers can infer their secrets by exploiting the correlations among private and public information with background knowledge. To defend against such attacks, we formulate the social network data sharing problem through an optimization-based approach, which maximizes the users’ self-disclosure utility while preserving their privacy. We propose two privacy-preserving social network data sharing methods to counter the inference attack. One is the efficiency-based privacy-preserving disclosure algorithm (EPPD) targeting the high utility, and the other is to convert the original problem into a multi-dimensional knapsack problem (d-KP) using greedy heuristics with a low computational complexity.

It is a set of techniques used to discover patterns from a sequence of network packets generated while a user accesses different websites. Internet users (such as online activists or journalists) may wish to hide their identity and online activity to protect their privacy. Typically, an anonymity network is utilized for this purpose. These anonymity networks such as Tor (The Onion Router) provide layers of data encryption which poses a challenge to the traffic analysis techniques. Although various defenses have been proposed to counteract this passive attack, they have been penetrated by new attacks that proved the ineffectiveness and/or impracticality of such defenses. In this work, we introduce a novel defense algorithm to counteract the website fingerprinting attacks. The proposed defense obfuscates original website traffic patterns through the use of double sampling and mathematical optimization techniques to deform packet sequences and destroy traffic flow dependency characteristics used by attackers to identify websites.

However, due to the inaccessibility or the privacy issues of acquiring scholars’ personal data, there is little research to explore the true ages of scholars currently.

The experimental results on the real dataset demonstrate that our method can effectively predict the true ages of scholars.

The current state-of-theart inference attack on user behaviors (e.g., ratings/purchases on sensitive items) for CF is by Calandrino et al. (S&P, 2011). They showed that if an adversary obtained a moderate amount of user’s public behavior before some time T, she can infer user’s private behavior after time T. However, the existence of an attack that infers user’s private behavior before T remains open. In this paper, we propose the first inference attack that reveals past private user behaviors. Our attack departs from previous techniques and is based on model inversion (MI). In particular, we propose the first MI attack on factorization-based CF systems by leveraging data poisoning by Li et al. (NIPS, 2016) in a novel way. We inject malicious users into the CF system so that adversarialy chosen “decoy” items are linked with user’s private behaviors. We also show how to weaken the assumption made by Li et al. on the information available to the adversary from the whole rating matrix to only the item profile and how to create malicious ratings effectively. We validate the effectiveness of our inference algorithm using two real-world datasets.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.2478/popets-2020-0052","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"related_articles_were_imported":false,"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-08-02T11:22:24.313Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"is5Ld28hSMGZtIzAhHw/mA==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6107d570942a4b6254577022"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"YCZnhHtgS+Wk4OLqpNGyfA==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"Multifaceted Privacy: Express Your Online Persona without Revealing Your Sensitive Attribute","authors":["Victor Zakhary","Ishani Gupta","Rey Tang","A.

To achieve multifaceted privacy, we build Aegis, a prototype client-centric social network stream processing system that helps preserve multifaceted privacy, and thus allowing social network users to freely express their online personas without revealing their sensitive attributes of choice. Aegis continuously suggests topics and hashtags to social network users to write about in order to obfuscate their sensitive attributes and hence confuse content-based sensitive attribute inferences. Our experiments show that adding as few as 0 to 4 obfuscation posts (depending on how revealing the original post is) successfully hides a user sensitive attributes without changing the user's public persona attributes.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1145/3397536.3422253","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"related_articles_were_imported":true,"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-08-02T11:22:24.312Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"is5Ld28hSMGZtIzAhHw/mA==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"mmAYj2iNTwOPZxIBHS9itA==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6107d570942a4b6254577024"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"fz1bbWfxS4yDweiWu1EtjA==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"A Survey on Privacy in Social Media","authors":["BeigiGhazaleh","LiuHuan"],"date":{"$date":"2020-08-02T00:00:00.000Z"},"pdf_url":"https://doi.org/10.1145/3343038","abstract":"The increasing popularity of social media has attracted a huge number of people to participate in numerous activities on a daily basis.

On the other hand, there is a supplementary financial information source provided by the bank company. Combining the data of online social media with debit card transactions, we train machine learning models to infer the socioeconomic status (SES) of the user, as well as six purchasing patterns that characterize customer transactional activity of certain type. Namely, we detect if a user is a driver, parent, gamer, traveler, or he/she prefers to purchase at night/in the morning. SES is defined as average monthly expenses and considered as real number variable. The following features are extracted as predictors: demographic information from a user’s page, user participation in communities, topics of that communities, text embeddings of user posts, topological characteristics, and graph embeddings of nodes in the friendship graph. Obtained results show the superiority of graph embeddings in both classification and regression tasks (median absolute percentage error MedAPE = 29.7 for SES). Moreover, for drivers (Macro- $$F_1=0.688$$ F 1 = 0.688 ) and parents (Macro- $$F_1=0.679$$ F 1 = 0.679 ), the higher scores are reached by concatenation of different features.

Image sharing occurs not only within a group of friends but also more and more outside a user’s social circles for purposes of social discovery. Despite that current social networking sites allow users to change their privacy preferences, this is often a cumbersome task for the vast majority of users on the Web, who face difficulties in assigning and managing privacy settings. When these privacy settings are used inappropriately, online image sharing can potentially lead to unwanted disclosures and privacy violations. Thus, automatically predicting images’ privacy to warn users about private or sensitive content before uploading these images on social networking sites has become a necessity in our current interconnected world. In this article, we explore learning models to automatically predict appropriate images’ privacy as private or public using carefully identified image-specific features. We study deep visual semantic features that are derived from various layers of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) as well as textual features such as user tags and deep tags generated from deep CNNs. Particularly, we extract deep (visual and tag) features from four pre-trained CNN architectures for object recognition, i.e., AlexNet, GoogLeNet, VGG-16, and ResNet, and compare their performance for image privacy prediction. The results of our experiments obtained on a Flickr dataset of 32,000 images show that ResNet yeilds the best results for this task among all four networks. We also fine-tune the pre-trained CNN architectures on our privacy dataset and compare their performance with the models trained on pre-trained features. The results show that even though the overall performance obtained using the fine-tuned networks is comparable to that of pre-trained networks, the fine-tuned networks provide an improved performance for the private class. The results also show that the learning models trained on features extracted from ResNet outperform the state-of-the-art models for image privacy prediction. We further investigate the combination of user tags and deep tags derived from CNN architectures using two settings: (1) Support Vector Machines trained on the bag-of-tags features and (2) text-based CNN. We compare these models with the models trained on ResNet visual features and show that, even though the models trained on the visual features perform better than those trained on the tag features, the combination of deep visual features with image tags shows improvements in performance over the individual feature sets. We also compare our models with prior privacy prediction approaches and show that for private class, we achieve an improvement of ≈ 10% over prior CNN-based privacy prediction approaches.

In such an ML-equipped inference attack, an attacker has access to some data (called public data) of an individual, a software, or a system; and the attacker uses an ML classifier to automatically infer their private data. Inference attacks pose severe privacy and security threats to individuals and systems. Inference attacks are successful because private data are statistically correlated with public data, and ML classifiers can capture such statistical correlations. In this chapter, we discuss the opportunities and challenges of defending against ML-equipped inference attacks via adversarial examples. Our key observation is that attackers rely on ML classifiers in inference attacks. The adversarial machine learning community has demonstrated that ML classifiers have various vulnerabilities. Therefore, we can turn the vulnerabilities of ML into defenses against inference attacks. For example, ML classifiers are vulnerable to adversarial examples, which add carefully crafted noise to normal examples such that an ML classifier makes predictions for the examples as we desire. To defend against inference attacks, we can add carefully crafted noise into the public data to turn them into adversarial examples, such that attackers' classifiers make incorrect predictions for the private data. However, existing methods to construct adversarial examples are insufficient because they did not consider the unique challenges and requirements for the crafted noise at defending against inference attacks. In this chapter, we take defending against inference attacks in online social networks as an example to illustrate the opportunities and challenges.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1007/978-3-030-33432-1_2","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"related_articles_were_imported":true,"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-08-02T11:22:25.614Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"is5Ld28hSMGZtIzAhHw/mA==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6107d571942a4b625457702b"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"+hTjzb/8TgeLBvM9T/6QbQ==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"Privacy in targeted advertising: A survey","authors":["I.

As this data is often publicly available, users’ privacy is at risk. To address this issue, users may control the release of their sensitive data on OSNEM. An example of data that users rarely publish is their location. Besides being a privacy-sensitive information, location is a business-relevant data that third parties, e.g., Location-Based Service (LBS) providers, may be interested to obtain. It is, therefore, of paramount importance to understand to what extent the secrecy of location information can be violated. In this work, we investigate how users can measure the privacy of their geo-location on OSNEM and to control the factors affecting it. We define the privacy of a target user as the geographical distance between her actual unexposed location and the location estimated by an attacker. To measure privacy, we propose a novel deep learning architecture that uncovers a target user’s position based only on the publicly-available locations shared by users on Twitter. Results show that locations can be accurately unveiled for the majority of the users, thus suggesting the need for countermeasures to improve their privacy. To control privacy, we propose data perturbation techniques that users can apply to tune the public exposure of their location, and we show the resulting privacy improvements. To shed light on the factors influencing privacy, we then propose a machine learning model that measures privacy based on several users’ features (e.g., social and behavioral characteristics). Unlike the aforementioned deep learning approach, this model also allows to quantify the impact that each feature has on privacy. We observe that features related to the history of users’ visited locations proved to be the most relevant factors affecting privacy. Finally, we explore potential side effects resulting from the application of data perturbation strategies. In particular, we examine, as a study case, the trade-off between users’ privacy and the effectiveness of a proximity marketing LBS. Results suggest that privacy can be guaranteed while not significantly lowering the effectiveness of the LBS.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1016/j.osnem.2020.100078","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"related_articles_were_imported":false,"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-08-02T11:22:26.407Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"is5Ld28hSMGZtIzAhHw/mA==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6107d572942a4b625457702e"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"x7uQ68DBTkuXhQHaiZdvkQ==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"A Survey of Sentiment Analysis from Social Media Data","authors":["Koyel Chakraborty","S.

This work is the first attempt to build a Recommendation with Attribute Protection (RAP) model which simultaneously recommends relevant items and counters private-attribute inference attacks. The key idea of our approach is to formulate this problem as an adversarial learning problem with two main components: the private attribute inference attacker, and the Bayesian personalized recommender. The attacker seeks to infer users' private-attribute information according to their items list and recommendations. The recommender aims to extract users' interests while employing the attacker to regularize the recommendation process.

These works study privacy issues in social media from the two different points of views: identification of vulnerabilities and mitigation of privacy risks. Recent research has shown the vulnerability of user-generated data against the two general types of attacks, identity disclosure and attribute disclosure. These privacy issues mandate social media data publishers to protect users’ privacy by sanitizing user-generated data before publishing it. Consequently, various protection techniques have been proposed to anonymize user-generated social media data. There is vast literature on privacy of users in social media from many perspectives.

Our model allows us to solve many algorithmic problems while providing absolute (deterministic) guarantees of the privacy of on-device data and the user's contacts. In fact, we ensure that the private data and private contacts are never revealed to the central system. Our restrictive model of computation presents several interesting algorithmic challenges because any computation based on private information and contacts must be performed on local devices of limited capabilities. Despite these challenges, under realistic assumptions of inter-device communication, we show several efficient algorithms for fundamental data mining and machine learning problems, ranging from k-means clustering to heavy hitters. We complement this analysis with strong impossibility results for efficient private algorithms without allowing inter-device communication. In our experimental evaluation, we show that our private algorithms provide results almost as accurate as those of the non-private ones while speeding up the on-device computations by orders of magnitude.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1145/3308558.3313677","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"related_articles_were_imported":true,"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-08-02T11:22:28.403Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"is5Ld28hSMGZtIzAhHw/mA==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6107d574942a4b6254577032"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"6/g1T1A8QtG9xFPxDCCSpA==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"Towards models for quantifying the known adversary","authors":["Alaadin Addas","J.

Distinctly, this may only get the suboptimal solution of the problem. To settle the above issues, a novel Deep Neural Network method for node classification named DNNNC is proposed in the framework of Deep Learning. Specifically, we first get the positive pointwise mutual information (PPMI) matrix from the given adjacency matrix. Then, the data is fed to deep neural network composed of deep stacked sparse autoencoders and softmax layer, which could learn the node representation while encoding the rich nonlinear structural and semantic information and could be well trained for node classification under the DNN framework.

This article proposes an information speculation method based on the core users of spatial social networks, and estimates the non-core user information through the core user public information. First, the user’s spatial social network is divided into communities, and the core nodes of the community in the spatial social network are calculated by PageRank algorithm and the convergence of the algorithm is proved. Then, through the public information of the core nodes divided by the community in the space social network, the private information of relevant users to these core nodes can be speculated.

However, the information (e.g., posts, user profiles, etc.) shared on the social network platforms usually reflects many users’ personal (private) information, which could be mined and abused for malicious purposes. To address privacy concerns, many social network service providers adopted privacy-preserving mechanisms, e.g., anonymizing user identity, hiding users’ profiles, etc. As a result, the attributes in user profiles are usually set up to be accessed only by friends to prevent privacy leakage. Several attacks have been proposed to infer the hidden attributes to Several the efficiency of current privacy-protecting mechanisms. Most of these solutions are based on the social links among users or their behaviors. In this paper, we systematically analyze the social features related to user privacy inference and found that there are relevances among social attributes, which has a great impact on inferring users’ hidden attributes. According to our findings, we propose an efficient social attribute inference scheme based on social links and attribute relevance properties. We develop a relevance attribute inference method (ReAI) using random walks with restart. We analyze attribute relevance on inference performance and use Kulczynski measure to quantify attribute relevance as edge weights of attribute nodes in an improved social-attribute network. We evaluate our method and compare it with the traditional attribute inference method. The results show that our method performs better than the traditional method. We also use Kulczynski measure and Information Gain Ratio to evaluate the improvements.

We assess these metrics through agent simulations in well-known models of networks. The findings show a strong relationship between metrics and structural centrality network properties. We also studied scenarios where there is no previous information about users activity or the information about the traces of the messages cannot be obtained. To deal with privacy assessment in these scenarios, we analyze the relationship between the proposed privacy metrics and local centrality properties as an estimation of privacy risk.

The providers of OSNs typically leverage demographic attributes of users in OSNs to perform business behaviors like personalized commodity recommendation, advertisement delivery, etc. Thus, understanding demographic attributes of users in OSNs is of great importance. However, some users refuse to reveal their demographic information due to privacy concerns. Therefore, inferring demographic attributes of users in OSNs with public information is an attractive topic for researchers. Most existing methods mainly focus on individual attribute inference without taking the relationship among attributes into account, which results in low precisions. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, called DeepAttr, to infer users’ multiple attributes simultaneously. DeepAttr leverages existing network embedding algorithm to learn the social embedding for each user. Meanwhile, it encodes multiple attributes into structured attribute vectors which are treated as class labels. The core component of DeepAttr is a multi-layer fully connected deep neural network which captures complex nonlinear mapping between the users’ social embeddings and the structured attribute vectors. Extensive experiments on a real-world dataset demonstrate that DeepAttr outperforms existing models in both single-attribute inference and multiple-attribute inference as to macro-Precision, macro-Recall, and macro-F1.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2940752","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"related_articles_were_imported":false,"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-08-02T11:22:46.638Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"is5Ld28hSMGZtIzAhHw/mA==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6107d586942a4b625457703d"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"Mjw/E9K1Qe22h7By+HQ51g==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"A Large-Scale Empirical Study of Internet Users' Privacy Leakage in China","authors":["Y.

Finally, we fuse the decisions of the most competent modalities and predict the privacy label for the target image.

State-of-the-art collective classification methods for such graph-based security and privacy analytics follow the following paradigm: assign weights to edges of the graph, iteratively propagate reputation scores of nodes among the weighted graph, and use the final reputation scores to classify nodes in the graph. The key challenge is to assign edge weights such that an edge has a large weight if the two corresponding nodes have the same label, and a small weight otherwise. Although collective classification has been studied and applied for security and privacy problems for more than a decade, how to address this challenge is still an open question. In this work, we propose a novel collective classification framework to address this long-standing challenge. We first formulate learning edge weights as an optimization problem, which quantifies the goals about the final reputation scores that we aim to achieve. However, it is computationally hard to solve the optimization problem because the final reputation scores depend on the edge weights in a very complex way. To address the computational challenge, we propose to jointly learn the edge weights and propagate the reputation scores, which is essentially an approximate solution to the optimization problem. We compare our framework with state-of-the-art methods for graph-based security and privacy analytics using four large-scale real-world datasets from various application scenarios such as Sybil detection in social networks, fake review detection in Yelp, and attribute inference attacks. Our results demonstrate that our framework achieves higher accuracies than state-of-the-art methods with an acceptable computational overhead.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.14722/ndss.2019.23226","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"related_articles_were_imported":false,"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-08-02T11:22:47.564Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"is5Ld28hSMGZtIzAhHw/mA==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"TM1S7qo6QNqQVBuUKOoHQw==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6107d587942a4b6254577041"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"0dMnKRnMS7iBi2erXT8roA==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"Data Mining Based Privacy Attack Through Paper Traces","authors":["M.

We attack this problem through a combination of a user study and the development of automated inference of potentially mismatched privacy settings. A total of 78 Facebook users reevaluated the privacy settings for five of their Facebook posts, also indicating whether a selection of friends should be able to access each post. They also explained their decision. With this user data, we designed a classifier to identify posts with currently incorrect sharing settings.

To date, this threat has only been addressed from the perspective of a central authority, completely neglecting the possibility that members of the social network can themselves mitigate such threats. We fill this gap by studying how an individual can rewire her own network neighborhood to hide her sensitive relationships. We prove that the optimization problem faced by such an individual is NP-complete, meaning that any attempt to identify an optimal way to hide one’s relationships is futile. Based on this, we shift our attention towards developing effective, albeit not optimal, heuristics that are readily-applicable by users of existing social media platforms to conceal any connections they deem sensitive. Our empirical evaluation reveals that it is more beneficial to focus on “unfriending” carefully-chosen individuals rather than befriending new ones. In fact, by avoiding communication with just 5 individuals, it is possible for one to hide some of her relationships in a massive, real-life telecommunication network, consisting of 829,725 phone calls between 248,763 individuals. Our analysis also shows that link prediction algorithms are more susceptible to manipulation in smaller and denser networks. Evaluating the error vs. attack tolerance of link prediction algorithms reveals that rewiring connections randomly may end up exposing one’s sensitive relationships, highlighting the importance of the strategic aspect. In an age where personal relationships continue to leave digital traces, our results empower the general public to proactively protect their private relationships.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1038/s41598-019-48583-6","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"related_articles_were_imported":true,"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-08-02T11:22:48.101Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"is5Ld28hSMGZtIzAhHw/mA==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6107d588942a4b6254577044"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"AeShHh/xRey2MAbxeWd63Q==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"Privacy Concerns in Online Social Networks: A Users’ Perspective","authors":["Ahmad Ali","Ahmad Kamran","Mansoor Ahmed","B.

We present a social link mining technique and demonstrate how private and sensitive information in the form of social relationships between travellers can be revealed.

Previous work on user attribute inference mainly concentrated on developing advanced features/models or exploiting external information and knowledge but ignored the contradiction between dynamic behaviors and stable demographic attributes, which results in deviation of user understanding To address the contradiction and accurately infer the user attributes, we propose a Multi-source User Attribute Inference algorithm based on Hierarchical Auto-encoder (MUAI-HAE). The basic idea is that: the shared patterns among the same individual's behaviors on different OSNs well indicate his/her stable demographic attributes. The hierarchical autoencoder is introduced to realize this idea by discovering the underlying non-linear correlation between different OSNs.

Most of the existing network node classification algorithms are concentrated on the unsigned social network, or the network containing only positive links. Rare works study the node classification on signed social networks, where each link is assigned a positive or negative sign. Recently, the research of the signed network has proved that the negative link has more effect on the signed network analysis than the positive links. Therefore, negative links play a key role in many tasks of signed network analysis. In this paper, we study the classification of nodes in the signed network. We project the positive and negative network to the corresponding latent space, and propose a mathematical model based on latent space. An iterative algorithm is proposed to optimize the model, and the iterative optimization of latent space matrix and projection matrix is used to classify the nodes in the network. The experimental results of the data set of the signed social network show that the classification results of the algorithm have high accuracy.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1109/ICDMW.2019.00095","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"related_articles_were_imported":false,"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-08-02T11:22:49.015Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"is5Ld28hSMGZtIzAhHw/mA==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6107d589942a4b6254577049"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"I25cBzhBQu6hLjQeWWPOww==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"Improving Agent Quality in Dynamic Smart Cities by Implementing an Agent Quality Management Framework","authors":["N.

It is critical to preserve users' privacy without preventing them from socialization and sharing. Unfortunately, existing solutions fall short meeting such requirements. We argue that the key component of OSN privacy protection is protecting (sensitive) content -- privacy as having the ability to control information dissemination. We follow the concepts of private information boundaries and restricted access and limited control to introduce a social circle model. We articulate the formal constructs of this model and the desired properties for privacy protection in the model. We show that the social circle model is efficient yet practical, which provides certain level of privacy protection capabilities to users, while still facilitates socialization. We then utilize this model to analyze the most popular social network platforms on the Internet (Facebook, Google+, WeChat, etc), and demonstrate the potential privacy vulnerabilities in some social networks.

Mediating access to information and explicitly or implicitly ranking people in increasingly many applications, search systems have a substantial potential to contribute to such unwanted outcomes. Since they collect vast amounts of data about both searchers and search subjects, they have the potential to violate the privacy of both of these groups of users. Moreover, in applications where rankings influence people’s economic livelihood outside of the platform, such as sharing economy or hiring support websites, search engines have an immense economic power over their users in that they control user exposure in ranked results. This thesis develops new models and methods broadly covering different aspects of privacy and fairness in search systems for both searchers and search subjects. Specifically, it makes the following contributions: • We propose a model for computing individually fair rankings where search subjects get exposure proportional to their relevance. The exposure is amortized over time using constrained optimization to overcome searcher attention biases while preserving ranking utility. • We propose a model for computing sensitive search exposure where each subject gets to know the sensitive queries that lead to her profile in the top-k search results. The problem of finding exposing queries is technically modeled as reverse nearest neighbor search, followed by a weekly-supervised learning to rank model ordering the queries by privacy-sensitivity. • We propose a model for quantifying privacy risks from textual data in online communities. The method builds on a topic model where each topic is annotated by a crowdsourced sensitivity score, and privacy risks are associated with a user’s relevance to sensitive topics. We propose relevance measures capturing different dimensions of user interest in a topic and show how they correlate with human risk perceptions. • We propose a model for privacy-preserving personalized search where search queries of different users are split and merged into synthetic profiles. The model mediates the privacy-utility trade-off by keeping semantically coherent fragments of search histories within individual profiles, while trying to minimize the similarity of any of the synthetic profiles to the original user profiles. The models are evaluated using information retrieval techniques and user studies over a variety of datasets, ranging from query logs, through social media and community question answering postings, to item listings from sharing economy platforms.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.22028/D291-27886","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"related_articles_were_imported":false,"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-08-02T11:22:50.445Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"is5Ld28hSMGZtIzAhHw/mA==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6107d58a942a4b625457704c"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"cQVPX13LTB69xKwJ5jvLwA==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"Type Prediction Combining Linked Open Data and Social Media","authors":["Yaroslav Nechaev","F.

However, before studying such a network, one must first collect appropriate network data. Collecting accurate network data in such a setting is a challenging task, as data collectors will make inferences, which may be incorrect, based on available intelligence data, which may itself be misleading. In this paper, we consider the problem of how to effectively sample dark networks, in which sampling queries may return incorrect information, with the specific goal of locating people of interest. We present RedLearn and RedLearnRS, two algorithms for crawling dark networks with the goal of maximizing the identification of nodes of interest, given a limited sampling budget. RedLearn assumes that a query on a node can accurately return whether a node represents a person of interest, while RedLearnRS dispenses with that assumption. We consider realistic error scenarios, which describe how individuals in a dark network may attempt to conceal their connections. We evaluate and present results on several real-world networks, including dark networks, as well as various synthetic dark network structures proposed in the criminology literature. Our analysis shows that RedLearn and RedLearnRS meet or outperform other sampling strategies.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1007/s13278-018-0487-0","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"related_articles_were_imported":true,"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-08-02T11:22:54.658Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"is5Ld28hSMGZtIzAhHw/mA==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6107d58f942a4b6254577051"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"drfZ3sTBSeyP/qNd7n5i/Q==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"On Consent in Online Social Networks: Privacy Impacts and Research Directions (Short Paper)","authors":["S.

This question is important because of the protection given to data in law and ethics. Healthcare data are universally considered sensitive (and confidential), so it might seem that the categorisation of less sensitive data is relatively unimportant for medical data research. This paper will explore the arguments that this is not necessarily the case and the relevance of recognizing this. The categorization of data and information requires re-evaluation in the age of Big Data in order to ensure that the appropriate protections are given to different types of data. The aggregation of large amounts of data requires an assessment of the harms and benefits that pertain to large datasets linked together, rather than simply assessing each datum or dataset in isolation. Big Data produce new data via inferences, and this must be recognized in ethical assessments. We propose a schema for a granular assessment of data categories. The use of schemata such as this will assist decision-making by providing research ethics committees and information governance bodies with guidance about the relative sensitivities of data. This will ensure that appropriate and proportionate safeguards are provided for data research subjects and reduce inconsistency in decision making.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1016/j.bdr.2017.11.001","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"related_articles_were_imported":false,"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-08-02T11:23:07.435Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"is5Ld28hSMGZtIzAhHw/mA==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6107d59c942a4b6254577053"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"fIaovNmBQSO7E1tjDvTWiw==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"Detecting Malicious Behaviors in JavaScript Applications","authors":["Jian Mao","Jingdong Bian","Guangdong Bai","Ruilong Wang","Yueh-Ting Chen","Yinhao Xiao","Zhenkai Liang"],"date":{"$date":"2018-08-02T00:00:00.000Z"},"pdf_url":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8263218","abstract":"JavaScript applications are widely used in a range of scenarios, including Web applications, mobile applications, and server-side applications.

While homophily describes a bias in attribute preferences for similar others, it gives limited attention to variability. Here, we observe that attribute preferences can exhibit variation beyond what can be explained by homophily. We call this excess variation monophily to describe the presence of individuals with extreme preferences for a particular attribute possibly unrelated to their own attribute. We observe that monophily can induce a similarity among friends-of-friends without requiring any similarity among friends. To simulate homophily and monophily in synthetic networks, we propose an overdispersed extension of the classical stochastic block model. We use this model to demonstrate how homophily-based methods for predicting attributes on social networks based on friends (that is, 'the company you keep') are fundamentally different from monophily-based methods based on friends-of-friends (that is, 'the company you’re kept in'). We place particular focus on predicting gender, where homophily can be weak or non-existent in practice. These findings offer an alternative perspective on network structure and prediction, complicating the already difficult task of protecting privacy on social networks.Altenburger and Ugander identify ‘monophily’ or the overdispersion of attribute preferences in a social network and show that it can be used to predict otherwise hidden attribute information about an individual.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1038/s41562-018-0321-8","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"related_articles_were_imported":true,"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-08-02T11:23:08.710Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"is5Ld28hSMGZtIzAhHw/mA==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6107d59c942a4b6254577056"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"/thQTjAvT3O56Otqm5shEQ==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"I Have Issues with Facebook: But I Will Keep Using It","authors":["Ons Al-Shamaileh"],"date":{"$date":"2018-08-02T00:00:00.000Z"},"pdf_url":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8371516","abstract":"Today, social media is one of the dominant channels for communicating and collaborating among individuals and organizations.

In this work, we focus on node-attributed networks and introduce: (1) a new measure of subgraph quality for attributed communities called normality, (2) a community extraction algorithm that uses normality to extract communities and a few characterizing attributes per community, and (3) a summarization and interactive visualization approach for attributed graph exploration. More specifically, (1) we first introduce a new measure to quantify the normality of an attributed subgraph. Our normality measure carefully utilizes structure and attributes together to quantify both the internal consistency and external separability. We then formulate an objective function to automatically infer a few attributes (called the “focus”) and respective attribute weights, so as to maximize the normality score of a given subgraph. Most notably, unlike many other approaches, our measure allows for many cross-edges as long as they can be “exonerated;” i.e., either (i) are expected under a null graph model, and/or (ii) their boundary nodes do not exhibit the focus attributes. Next, (2) we propose AMEN (for Attributed Mining of Entity Networks), an algorithm that simultaneously discovers the communities and their respective focus in a given graph, with a goal to maximize the total normality. Communities for which a focus that yields high normality cannot be found are considered low quality or anomalous. Last, (3) we formulate a summarization task with a multi-criteria objective, which selects a subset of the communities that (i) cover the entire graph well, are (ii) high quality and (iii) diverse in their focus attributes. We further design an interactive visualization interface that presents the communities to a user in an interpretable, user-friendly fashion. The user can explore all the communities, analyze various algorithm-generated summaries, as well as devise their own summaries interactively to characterize the network in a succinct way. As the experiments on real-world attributed graphs show, our proposed approaches effectively find anomalous communities and outperform several existing measures and methods, such as conductance, density, OddBall, and SODA. We also conduct extensive user studies to measure the capability and efficiency that our approach provides to the users toward network summarization, exploration, and sensemaking.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1145/3139241","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"related_articles_were_imported":true,"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-08-02T11:23:09.470Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"is5Ld28hSMGZtIzAhHw/mA==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"5aPlQBrGSQul8aYkQ8BYeQ==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6107d59d942a4b6254577059"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"pqU7t/WmQMaUF7KIr9XHRw==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"Progressive Scrambling for Social Media","authors":["W.

They can contribute to building new friendships as well as reviving and enhancing existing ones. However, the personal data revealed by the user himself or by his vicinity, i.e., his OSN friends, can also make him vulnerable to many privacy harms such as identity theft, stalking or sexual predation. So users have to carefully select the privacy settings for their profile attributes by keeping in mind the trade-off between privacy and social benefit. In this paper, we propose a usercentric two-phase approach, based on Integer Programming, to choose the right privacy settings. Our model assists the user to understand which privacy harms he can avoid, after tolerating residual risks, given his desired social benefit requirements and suggests the privacy settings he should adopt to achieve the maximum social benefit. Thus, users’ choices are based on both privacy risks and benefits, a view supported by the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). We have tested our approach on user profiles with varying vicinities and social benefit requirements.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1109/PST.2018.8514202","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"related_articles_were_imported":false,"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-08-02T11:23:09.995Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"is5Ld28hSMGZtIzAhHw/mA==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6107d59e942a4b625457705d"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"2OQ5PnDXSPSTk8xPYfv83Q==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"Differentially Private Recommendation System Based on Community Detection in Social Network Applications","authors":["Gesu Li","Z.

Our attacks leverage seemingly innocent user information that is publicly available in online social networks to infer missing attributes of targeted users. Given the increasing availability of (seemingly innocent) user information online, our results have serious implications for Internet privacy—private attributes can be inferred from users’ publicly available data unless we take steps to protect users from such inference attacks. To infer attributes of a targeted user, existing inference attacks leverage either the user’s publicly available social friends or the user’s behavioral records (e.g., the web pages that the user has liked on Facebook, the apps that the user has reviewed on Google Play), but not both. As we will show, such inference attacks achieve limited success rates. However, the problem becomes qualitatively different if we consider both social friends and behavioral records. To address this challenge, we develop a novel model to integrate social friends and behavioral records, and design new attacks based on our model. We theoretically and experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness of our attacks. For instance, we observe that, in a real-world large-scale dataset with 1.1 million users, our attack can correctly infer the cities a user lived in for 57% of the users; via confidence estimation, we are able to increase the attack success rate to over 90% if the attacker selectively attacks half of the users. Moreover, we show that our attack can correctly infer attributes for significantly more users than previous attacks.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1145/3154793","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"related_articles_were_imported":true,"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-08-02T11:23:10.800Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"is5Ld28hSMGZtIzAhHw/mA==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"TM1S7qo6QNqQVBuUKOoHQw==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"H4VF5wLTS4iyc0/7vBUBvA==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"mmAYj2iNTwOPZxIBHS9itA==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"CLmKq1y+SwGB3IaAKTtpsg==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"fz1bbWfxS4yDweiWu1EtjA==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"Q4KCxuFaTmObaTHWlfcpAw==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"0N3VmiEnQTWPWzOnD9BCow==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"+SG+6Kb+R0OpwTUhKpjH/g==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"Ik7ia/a9ShG5myVmw8Byfw==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"2OQ5PnDXSPSTk8xPYfv83Q==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6107d59f942a4b625457705f"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"QAbet1fWSmW19Sp22/IViQ==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"Collective aspects of privacy in the Twitter social network","authors":["David García","Mansi Goel","Amod Kant Agrawal","P.

Online social networks exist in application ecosystems that allow them to access data from other services, for example gathering contact lists through mobile phone applications. Such data access might allow social networking sites to create shadow profiles with information about non-users that has been inferred from information shared by the users of the social network. This possibility motivates the shadow profile hypothesis: the data shared by the users of an online service predicts personal information of non-users of the service. We test this hypothesis for the first time on Twitter, constructing a dataset of users that includes profile biographical text, location information, and bidirectional friendship links. We evaluate the predictability of the location of a user by using only information given by friends of the user that joined Twitter before the user did. This way, we audit the historical prediction power of Twitter data for users that had not joined Twitter yet. Our results indicate that information shared by users in Twitter can be predictive of the location of individuals outside Twitter. Furthermore, we observe that the quality of this prediction increases with the tendency of Twitter users to share their mobile phone contacts and is more accurate for individuals with more contacts inside Twitter. We further explore the predictability of biographical information of non-users, finding evidence in line with our results for locations. These findings illustrate that individuals are not in full control of their online privacy and that sharing personal data with a social networking site is a decision that is collectively mediated by the decisions of others.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1140/epjds/s13688-018-0130-3","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"related_articles_were_imported":true,"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-08-02T11:23:11.158Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"is5Ld28hSMGZtIzAhHw/mA==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"6i69bBC4Rpazx+yDgg8mAQ==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6107d59f942a4b6254577060"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"cC267UAKRsWdihMMQGS9/A==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"SocialLink: exploiting graph embeddings to link DBpedia entities to Twitter profiles","authors":["Yaroslav Nechaev","F.

Previous research has shown that individuals can be identified by a small number of geolocated nodes in their mobility network, rendering mobility trace anonymization a hard task. In this paper we build on prior work and demonstrate that even when all location and timestamp information is removed from nodes, the graph topology of an individual mobility network itself is often uniquely identifying. Further, we observe that a mobility network is often unique, even when only a small number of the most popular nodes and edges are considered. We evaluate our approach using a large dataset of cell-tower location traces from 1 500 smartphone handsets with a mean duration of 430 days. We process the data to derive the top−N places visited by the device in the trace, and find that 93% of traces have a unique top−10 mobility network, and all traces are unique when considering top−15 mobility networks. Since mobility patterns, and therefore mobility networks for an individual, vary over time, we use graph kernel distance functions, to determine whether two mobility networks, taken at different points in time, represent the same individual. We then show that our distance metrics, while imperfect predictors, perform significantly better than a random strategy and therefore our approach represents a significant loss in privacy.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1515/popets-2018-0018","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"related_articles_were_imported":false,"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-08-02T11:23:12.418Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"is5Ld28hSMGZtIzAhHw/mA==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6107d5a0942a4b6254577063"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"H9R3FmJvRNWlRVsDtT/FcA==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"OSSINT - Open Source Social Network Intelligence An efficient and effective way to uncover ","authors":["Giuseppe Cascavilla","Filipe Beato","Andrea Burattin","M.

However, the complexity of tuning them undermine their efficiency when shielding contextual information (such as the social network structure) that many users believe being kept private. In this paper, we demonstrate the extent of the problem of information leakage in Facebook. In particular, we show the possibility of inferring, from the network “surrounding” a victim user, some information that the victim set as hidden. We developed a system, named OSSINT (Open Source Social Network INTelligence), on top of our previous tool SocialSpy, that can infer hidden information of a victim profile and retrieve private information from public one. OSSINT retrieves the friendship network of a victim and shows how it is possible to infer additional private information (e.g., personal user preferences and hobbies). Our proposed system OSSINT goes extra mile about the network topology information, i.e., predicting new friendships using the victim’s friends of friends network (2-hop of distance from the victim profile), and hence possibly deduce private information of the full Facebook network. OSSINT correctly improved the previous results of SocialSpy predicting an average of 11 new friendships with peaks of 20 new friends. Moreover, OSSINT, for the considered victim profiles demonstrated how it is possible to infer real-life information such as current city, hometown, university, supposed being private.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1016/j.osnem.2018.04.003","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"related_articles_were_imported":false,"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-08-02T11:23:12.555Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"is5Ld28hSMGZtIzAhHw/mA==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6107d5a0942a4b6254577064"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"12Tysd3TS6ujBDebrf8qsw==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"Privacy-preserving Anonymization with Restricted Search (PARS) on Social Network Data for Criminal Investigations","authors":["Waqar Asif","I.

These organizations take cover behind the user data/identity privacy policies, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) [2] and Safe Harbor [4], which limit the Law Enforcement Agencies (LEAs) from accessing and analysing social media data without the consent of the users. Their veil is complemented by the fact that these malicious organization can operate from any part of the world and LEAs from different countries dither in sharing intelligence information among themselves. To overcome this issue, in this paper we propose a novel Privacy-preserving Anonymization with Restricted Search (PARS) approach which will provide LEAs with the leverage they need to access and analyse social media data without compromising individual privacy. We propose a new privacy concious node grouping approach that antagonizes relational information of a social network platform and we compliment this approach with the Public-key Encryption with Keyword Search (PEKS) mechanism that will enable LEAs to perform a restrictive search among each others' dataset without violating the privacy or leakage of the entire dataset to a third party. The proposed approach is applied on a Twitter dataset comprising of 277359 users that comment, re-tweet and/or like 11528 tweets and encryption and search times are evaluated.

This adherence has been so strong that even new psychiatric pathologies have been risen around them. Notwithstanding the numerous benefits of using social networking services, these systems live from information share between their users, and very often this information is private. Although social network services have numerous privacy and security settings, and management features, many users choose consciously or unintentionally to make excessive or uncontrolled sharing of personal information with social network services. This supposed controlled sharing of personal information on social media can put people at risk, or even in threatening situations, either to the individual himself or to others, linked to his network or family. An exploratory study was conducted through a focus group involving 12 college students attending the first year of an undergraduate program. This study aims, particularly, to understand how college students perceive their own online exposition, and the importance that this has on their privacy and the security of information shared, in social networking services. The data gathered from the focus group was analyzed with an online content analysis software – using the Leximancer platform. From the content analysis of the focus group several important concepts emerged: social network companies, location information, information sharing and distribution, user awareness changes. Findings suggest students are getting a new approach to privacy concerns over social media. Even though they are aware of the risks inherent in over-sharing private data, when faced with “to share or not to share” very often they tend to overlook the privacy concerns in favour of the social exposition. The obtained items and concepts were also used to develop a questionnaire, to be answered by a population of college students, in a subsequent study.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.21125/iceri.2018.1864","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"related_articles_were_imported":false,"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-08-02T11:23:13.552Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"is5Ld28hSMGZtIzAhHw/mA==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6107d5a2942a4b6254577066"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"/jaEa2IwRFm9g4z6/cpneA==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"Adversarial Image Perturbation for Privacy Protection A Game Theory Perspective","authors":["Seong Joon Oh","Mario Fritz","B.

Classic obfuscation methods such as blurring are not only unpleasant but also not as effective as one would expect [28, 37, 18]. Recent studies on adversarial image perturbations (AIP) suggest that it is possible to confuse recognition systems effectively without unpleasant artifacts. However, in the presence of counter measures against AIPs [7], it is unclear how effective AIP would be in particular when the choice of counter measure is unknown. Game theory provides tools for studying the interaction between agents with uncertainties in the strategies. We introduce a general game theoretical framework for the user-recogniser dynamics, and present a case study that involves current state of the art AIP and person recognition techniques. We derive the optimal strategy for the user that assures an upper bound on the recognition rate independent of the recogniser’s counter measure.

The basic assumption for the proposed approach is that, the same user’s cross-OSN behaviors are the reflection of his/her demographic attributes in different scenarios. Based on this, a coupled projection matrix extraction method is proposed for solution, where the cross-OSN behaviors are collectively projected onto the same space for demographic attribute inference.

To prevent this type of privacy violation, we propose a view-based protection model, in which a sanitizing transformation, called a view, is applied to the user profile when it is queried by a third-party extension. We demonstrate empirically that such a protection mechanism effectively reduces the statistical correlation between sensitive and accessible information. We also propose an optimization in which the materialization of views is performed lazily: rather than sanitizing the entire profile during a query, only the parts of the profile that are visible to the query are transformed. We demonstrate empirically that this optimization offers visible performance advantage, and propose a programming language-independent, probabilistic automata model for encoding such transformations.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1145/3078861.3078867","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"related_articles_were_imported":true,"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-08-02T11:23:14.558Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"is5Ld28hSMGZtIzAhHw/mA==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6107d5a2942a4b6254577069"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"0y59K49GRiu1sFFllWvMbg==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"Follow But No Track: Privacy Preserved Profile Publishing in Cyber-Physical Social Systems","authors":["Xu Zheng","Z.

Indeed, it was shown that it is possible to infer additional information about a user from data shared by other users--- this type of information disclosure is called attribute disclosure. Such studies, however, were limited to a single social computing system. In reality, users have identities across several social computing systems and reveal different aspects of their lives in each. This enlarges considerably the scope of information disclosure, but also complicates its analysis. Indeed, when considering multiple social computing systems, information disclosure can be of two types: attribute disclosure or identity disclosure--- which relates to the risk of pinpointing, for a given identity in a social computing system, the identity of the same individual in another social computing system. This raises the key question: how do these two privacy risks relate to each other? In this paper, we perform the first combined study of attribute and identity disclosure risks across multiple social computing systems. We first propose a framework to quantify these risks. Our empirical evaluation on a real-world dataset from Facebook and Twitter then shows that, in some regime, there is a tradeoff between the two information disclosure risks, that is, users with a lower identity disclosure risk suffer a higher attribute disclosure risk. We investigate in depth the different parameters that impact this tradeoff.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1145/3110025.3110046","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"related_articles_were_imported":true,"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-08-02T11:23:14.953Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"is5Ld28hSMGZtIzAhHw/mA==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"fz1bbWfxS4yDweiWu1EtjA==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"0N3VmiEnQTWPWzOnD9BCow==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6107d5a3942a4b625457706b"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"GKsuXxLXQbmJNJhzFxJ0+A==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"Joint Label Inference in Networks","authors":["Deepayan Chakrabarti","S.

Although most research on online privacy has focused on inference of personal information of users, this data integration poses the question of whether it is possible to predict personal information of nonusers. This article tests the shadow profile hypothesis, which postulates that the data given by the users of an online service predict personal information of nonusers. Using data from a disappeared social networking site, we perform a historical audit to evaluate whether personal data of nonusers could have been predicted with the personal data and contact lists shared by the users of the site. We analyze personal information of sexual orientation and relationship status, which follow regular mixing patterns in the social network. Going back in time over the growth of the network, we measure predictor performance as a function of network size and tendency of users to disclose their contact lists. This article presents robust evidence supporting the shadow profile hypothesis and reveals a multiplicative effect of network size and disclosure tendencies that accelerates the performance of predictors.

Most existing approaches can infer user private attributes based on sufficient interaction history but could fail for new users with few ratings. In this paper, we present a novel preference elicitation method, with which a recommender system asks cold-start users to rate selected items adaptively and infer the demographics rapidly via a few interactions. Specifically, latent user profiles are learned across the tasks of demographic inference and rating prediction simultaneously, which enables knowledge transfer through the two related tasks and improves the prediction accuracy for both tasks. The proposed method can also facilitate the understanding of the tradeoff between user privacy and the utility of personalization. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate the performance of the proposed method in terms of the accuracy of both demographics inference and rating prediction.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1145/3127540.3127566","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"related_articles_were_imported":true,"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-08-02T11:23:31.608Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"is5Ld28hSMGZtIzAhHw/mA==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6107d5b4942a4b6254577076"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"RTix4vIdQOCNgUtuMfV8Ow==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"Extend Web Service Security Negotiation Framework in Privacy","authors":["Amira Abdelatey","Mohamed Elkawkagy","A.

In privacy negotiation, the negotiation communication structure uses a broker for negotiation; where each participant sends its attributes to the broker.

First, we phrase the problem of determining the amount of leaked information as Bayesian inference, which enables us to leverage existing probabilistic programming engines. Second, we present two synthesis procedures that add uncertainty to the program's outputs as a way of reducing the amount of leaked information: an optimal one based on SMT solving and a greedy one with quadratic running time. We implemented and evaluated our approach on 10 representative programs from multiple application domains.

Built on a foundation of trust – users connect to other users with common interests or overlapping personal trajectories – online social networks and the associated applications extract an unprecedented volume of personal information. Unsurprisingly, serious privacy and security risks emerged, positioning themselves along two main types of attacks: attacks that exploit the implicit trust embedded in declared social relationships; and attacks that harvest user’s personal information for ill-intended use. This article provides an overview of the privacy and security issues that emerged so far in OSNs. We introduce a taxonomy of privacy and security attacks in OSNs, we overview existing solutions to mitigate those attacks, and outline challenges still to overcome.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1016/j.osnem.2017.09.001","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"related_articles_were_imported":false,"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-08-02T11:23:32.279Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"is5Ld28hSMGZtIzAhHw/mA==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"xlWgWPliQlaj5iSLFaODpg==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6107d5b4942a4b6254577079"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"TCjFHw9nTsOYdNJmpPwa2A==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"LocBorg: Hiding Social Media User Location while Maintaining Online Persona","authors":["Victor Zakhary","Cetin Sahin","T.

Recent works show that it is possible to reveal sensitive attributes (e.g., location, gender, ethnicity, political views, etc.) of individuals by analyzing their social media streams. Although, the prediction of a user's sensitive attributes can be used to enhance the user experience in social media, revealing some attributes like the location could represent a threat on individuals. Users can obfuscate their location by posting about random topics linked to different locations. However, posting about random and sometimes contradictory topics that are not aligned with a user's online persona and posts could negatively affect the followers interested in her profile. This paper represents our vision about the future of user privacy on social media. Users can locally deploy a cyborg, an artificial intelligent system that helps people to defend their privacy on social media. We propose LocBorg, a location privacy preserving cyborg that protects users by obfuscating their location while maintaining their online persona. LocBorg analyzes the social media streams and recommends topics to write about that are similar to a user's topics of interest and aligned with the user's online persona but linked to other locations.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1145/3139958.3140057","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"related_articles_were_imported":true,"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-08-02T11:23:32.556Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"is5Ld28hSMGZtIzAhHw/mA==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"YCZnhHtgS+Wk4OLqpNGyfA==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6107d5b4942a4b625457707a"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"RYameQnGTaWLx2vs/MJGtQ==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"Hello, Facebook!

As web services become more social, such personal data relates to individuals and to their relationships. As a matter of fact, individuals also disclose online personal data that relates to other individuals (e.g., individuals store their address books, which contain the birthdate and contact information or their contacts, on cloud platforms). The research questions addressed in this article are the following: “How do data protection regulations apply in such cases and to which extent do they protect data subjects from privacy infringements committed by natural persons in such a digital and online context?” and “how such protection can be improved, if needed, by integrating new legal solutions, potentially coupled with technical solutions for achieving compliance and enforcement?” \nIn most regulations that aim to protect the personal data of individuals, including the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) enacted on April 27th, 2016, the definition of data controllers encompasses natural and legal persons. This means that, even if some exceptions can apply in specific cases, a natural person who manipulates personal data of other natural persons, as illustrated above, must in principle respect the regulation. In their definition of personal data, many regulations rely on the core notion of data subject and make two assumptions: (i) for a given piece of personal data, there is a single data subject, i.e., personal data relates to a single individual, the data subject, (ii) the individual who discloses the personal data to an online service is the data subject (they are one and the same person). But in fact, in many situations, personal data relates to several natural persons and the determination of the data subject(s) is not straightforward. In this article, this problem is introduced and illustrated through carefully chosen real-life examples rooted in the use of information and communication technologies. A classification is proposed for the aforementioned situations: it contains three broad categories based on the relation between the user of the data and the data subject. The considered examples are analysed through the lens of the recently adopted EU GDPR. The ability of the EU GDPR to protect individuals against such infringements is questioned and discussed.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.2139/ssrn.3034181","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"related_articles_were_imported":true,"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-08-02T11:23:33.467Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"is5Ld28hSMGZtIzAhHw/mA==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6107d5b5942a4b625457707c"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"O51KCy8mS6msdDvXdj3TvQ==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"Individuals’ Motivation for Joining a Social Group: Examining Their Homogeneity","authors":["Ruturaj Baber","Y.

The challenge in designing successful HMNs is that they cannot be developed and implemented in the same manner as networks of machines nodes alone, or following a wholly human-centric view of the network. The problem requires an interdisciplinary approach. Here, we review current research of relevance to HMNs across many disciplines. Extending the previous theoretical concepts of socio-technical systems, actor-network theory, cyber-physical-social systems, and social machines, we concentrate on the interactions among humans and between humans and machines. We identify eight types of HMNs: public-resource computing, crowdsourcing, web search engines, crowdsensing, online markets, social media, multiplayer online games and virtual worlds, and mass collaboration. We systematically select literature on each of these types and review it with a focus on implications for designing HMNs. Moreover, we discuss risks associated with HMNs and identify emerging design and development trends.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1145/3039868","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"related_articles_were_imported":true,"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-08-02T11:23:34.257Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"is5Ld28hSMGZtIzAhHw/mA==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6107d5b6942a4b625457707e"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"O8/bENa9QVmLm/ihMwmM0g==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"Self-Enforcing Access Control for Encrypted RDF","authors":["Javier D.

In this paper, we propose a flexible and dynamic mechanism for securely storing and efficiently querying RDF datasets.

State-of-the-art methods leverage a user's both public friends and public behaviors (e.g., page likes on Facebook, apps that the user reviewed on Google Play) to infer the user's private attributes. However, these methods suffer from two key limitations: 1) suppose we aim to infer a certain attribute for a target user using a training dataset, they only leverage the labeled users who have the attribute, while ignoring the label information of users who do not have the attribute; 2) they are inefficient because they infer attributes for target users one by one. As a result, they have limited accuracies and applicability in real-world social networks. In this work, we propose AttriInfer, a new method to infer user attributes in online social networks. AttriInfer can leverage both friends and behaviors, as well as the label information of training users who have an attribute and who do not have the attribute. Specifically, we model a social network as a pairwise Markov Random Field (pMRF). Given a training dataset, which consists of some users who have a certain attribute and some users who do not have a certain attribute, we compute the posterior probability that a target user has the attribute and use the posterior probability to infer attributes. In the basic version of AttriInfer, we use Loopy Belief Propagation (LBP) to compute the posterior probability. However, LBP is not scalable to very large-scale real-world social networks and not guaranteed to converge. Therefore, we further optimize LBP to be scalable and guaranteed to converge. We evaluated our method and compare it with state-of-the-art methods using a real-world Google+ dataset with 5.7M users. Our results demonstrate that our method substantially outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of both accuracy and efficiency.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1145/3038912.3052695","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"related_articles_were_imported":false,"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-08-02T11:23:34.717Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"is5Ld28hSMGZtIzAhHw/mA==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"TM1S7qo6QNqQVBuUKOoHQw==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"fDfDcLPFQuKHj9mKpGlB+Q==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"H4VF5wLTS4iyc0/7vBUBvA==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"i6nyJ7htQFyK5YqDCAnC1g==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"d8edC5lKQL2UcBDwrNPfEw==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"mmAYj2iNTwOPZxIBHS9itA==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"CLv5aVFRT++JV175B0CYXA==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"CLmKq1y+SwGB3IaAKTtpsg==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"fz1bbWfxS4yDweiWu1EtjA==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"0N3VmiEnQTWPWzOnD9BCow==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"+SG+6Kb+R0OpwTUhKpjH/g==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"xR1yOQT0QhekGvdXR52WfQ==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"Ik7ia/a9ShG5myVmw8Byfw==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"2OQ5PnDXSPSTk8xPYfv83Q==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6107d5b7942a4b6254577080"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"547YxshSTvSre9siclIe+w==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"Possibilistic interest discovery from uncertain information in social networks","authors":["M.

At last, this study provides users with substantive recommendations for the healthy development of social media.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1109/ICMLC.2017.8108976","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"related_articles_were_imported":false,"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-08-02T11:23:35.274Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"is5Ld28hSMGZtIzAhHw/mA==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6107d5b7942a4b6254577082"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"Va1Vm0T/QSmUHY06gzkRRA==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"Towards Inferring Communication Patterns in Online Social Networks","authors":["Ero Balsa","C.

On the one hand, previous studies have shown how it is possible to infer private attributes from publicly available data. On the other hand, no distinction exists between public and private data when we consider the ability of the online social network (OSN) provider to access them. Even when OSN users go to great lengths to protect their privacy, such as by using encryption or communication obfuscation, correlations between data may render these solutions useless. In this article, we study the relationship between private communication patterns and publicly available OSN data. Such a relationship informs both privacy-invasive inferences as well as OSN communication modelling, the latter being key toward developing effective obfuscation tools. We propose an inference model based on Bayesian analysis and evaluate, using a real social network dataset, how archetypal social graph features can lead to inferences about private communication. Our results indicate that both friendship graph and public traffic data may not be informative enough to enable these inferences, with time analysis having a non-negligible impact on their precision.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1145/3093897","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"related_articles_were_imported":true,"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-08-02T11:23:35.364Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"is5Ld28hSMGZtIzAhHw/mA==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"CLv5aVFRT++JV175B0CYXA==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"zza9jqT+Sr2vSGXMcx/f3w==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"vxDE92o/TsC9tNyscA8e5g==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"H+r9cx/dTDOSQ141nPzdbg==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"AZnBs6E3RK+A+A6sy8zJKA==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"iHR5OcNLTSWBCVGARFD47Q==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"lK6wjVugScyJw81o6nHKvQ==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"8vppmahXR/yY23268B3Wqg==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"2fPH1lE4SuKTle7uFrq6OQ==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"80w15QC9Sp6WF5hDnoTa0A==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"8eC4MK1yRYW1783UGV/8XQ==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"BeaPjA5xSBScytzWfyeYUw==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"xMPdG/7yQ7+zP22y51B6Vw==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"mfs0zojOQP+ZwpuskYgkkw==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"5b0QiHUjReukRUvLo0fQ9w==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"7962mWoIQJGB3DW7Tcs+Kw==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"x+R3js0uR8C7hFRBhJYIzA==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"xilan/IoSyi70MYGdF8p+w==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"1X3RFGm2SGy62iuB4bMa/Q==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"qfQJvh23Skqp1230vy1mPw==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"xDnflsLjTuOb+S/QNVPmrg==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"HRsYOYK2QuC698FSYbxmfw==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"HjsDfKc7QuKBIkER7aHg+w==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"EUnHkAgQQ2mQ2uj/UQdrzg==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"YJjauIipRoiFJFzs7WUEDg==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"BHuKbEDqRWmUF9teC+pL+w==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"M/iq47W7SiSTgDEeFr/Qfw==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"YvyjZ5C0TH+LluQGhlgyWA==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"b9R/L6AjSkqbQKzvvP2NEg==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"rHlIvmcAQpqqfhtv41ZhhA==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"Waj76GBxRNiNLDKaM+6TRg==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"0b8q2XIYS2mnih8EzCEf7Q==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"qwkyzty2TqyHjDAVB/kl4A==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"+44FC39RT9ivvrbp+BWqGA==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"PdfFtuLqTPqpMgFGSHCOYA==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6107d5b8942a4b6254577083"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"Er0PD/N8S4yZx4DNPfO2jg==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"Detecting In Situ Identity Fraud on Social Network Services: A Case Study With Facebook","authors":["Shan-Hung Wu","Man-Ju Chou","Chun-Hsiung Tseng","Yuh-Jye Lee","Kuan-Ta Chen"],"date":{"$date":"2017-08-02T00:00:00.000Z"},"pdf_url":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7362137","abstract":"With the growing popularity of Social Networking Services (SNSs), increasing amounts of sensitive information are stored online and linked to SNS accounts. The obvious value of SNS accounts gives rise to the identity fraud problem—unauthorized, stealthy use of SNS accounts. For example, anxious parents may use their children’s SNS accounts to spy on the children’s social interaction; or husbands/wives may check their spouses’ SNS accounts if they suspect infidelity. Stealthy identity fraud could happen to anyone and seriously invade the privacy of account owners. However, there is no known defense against such behavior when an attacker, possibly an acquaintance of the victim, gets access to the victim’s computing devices. In this paper, we propose to extend the use of continuous authentication to detect the in situ identity fraud incidents, which occurs when the attackers use the same accounts, the same devices, and IP addresses as the victims. Using Facebook as a case study, we show that it is possible to detect such incidents by analyzing SNS users’ browsing behavior. Our experiment results demonstrate that the approach can achieve higher than 80% detection accuracy within 2 min, and over 90% after 7 min of observation time.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1109/JSYST.2015.2504102","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"related_articles_were_imported":false,"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-08-02T11:23:36.100Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"is5Ld28hSMGZtIzAhHw/mA==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6107d5b8942a4b6254577084"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"NA1NExzKSTG3MycxxTHXTg==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"Online Social Networks Security: Threats, Attacks, and Future Directions","authors":["Ja'far Alqatawna","Alia Madain","Ala’ M.

Online Social Networks made a difference in many people’s lives and helped in opening avenues that were not possible before. However, as in any success story there is a downside. Cyber-attacks that used to have a small or limited effect can now have a huge distributed effect through utilizing those social network sites. Some attacks are more apparent than others in this context; hence this chapter discusses how serious attacks are possible in online social networks and what has been done to encounter them. It will discuss privacy, Sybil attacks, social engineering, spam, malware, botnet attacks, and the trade-off between services, security, and users’ rights.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1007/978-3-319-55354-2_10","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"related_articles_were_imported":true,"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-08-02T11:23:36.325Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"is5Ld28hSMGZtIzAhHw/mA==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"PhupTdqGTdahZhyUvS2JGQ==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"aiGZHW6HTFi1Psj/I5iaCg==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"Av4olA5BTL+B0jen6SMHMA==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"0A9n2w9bSnitrBM6SVrXvQ==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"T6mHx/ZoSRGXxIccJ7E0wA==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"VWesljZaT5CLLb5eCRL+xQ==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"ZjHHEEpiQje0w5zSatHz0A==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"Leue3fd+R3G+0fMVdSrw+A==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"VhTadh6+Tiit96z/Koz36g==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"IKBtxhgtTpS91ZDHpZkOyQ==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"rppGbfrTTk+ZkvRuLES5ew==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"yJVL3qy1ToqhX9mzbb0Uxw==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"z9krxIs6SFm+cZshJIrxrA==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"xOKv3XJbSNOlYiUG3kcayA==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"4VjKDLyURs6zOKwcrDtGMg==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"Tta4/Iv5S2+nBxadVXSKTg==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"B1rnWg11TRqp+zYDzKQEUg==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"W++IgNxBSMKsLfSS5OKryA==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"9JmlSZ2mRX2kb24rya0NEw==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"7//npzkAQsCqPjsKzaFP/g==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"TgxEhRUESjCIbCFj+4UUmA==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"DkrAeDyISluh85ccV6OWUA==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"Mvf7KX3JS+euS2daX/oe8A==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"RCZvc1FiT+6K5MZ6SVltZw==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"dhCsqXY2SYCq4w+AtZWUZg==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"KXz3kwYfQ3+jYXwqD6s4NQ==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"fs0WgB0PQdmcxI2hsW/ZOQ==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"/fh0szLHQ0OOo7Eg1LTVXA==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"lI91bL4qT3+2JnYe/RERdQ==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"VV4IbH9bSW++s7omJxdLNw==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"i9+W6fi+S/69qbsgvwtnBw==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"KhZtUXqYQc6kOMKSYyLPpg==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"s0QpYGb+TX+IkFgNf0abnw==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"cKH6EOUBSx+GIRl7Ulza6A==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"j6sYtJ60SuCU2zcKig5zgw==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"MtYQXQSOQ/WBpvq6qkmIxA==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"xKpwZSKDQ4aWv1xVjqdmmQ==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"vBG59RutQz2EvFZIs7j2XA==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"ELnBwZJoRjOk8D8yh9mczw==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"eJy0/3GRRriSVvWZdlzYEA==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"ZZJZ4u0SQ+OUBC2mKnsKqA==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"iKKxFjoQQL6wHO6c7ysbag==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"YgaeVhBsTqKwXb8McISExw==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"bsglmySQSEWrDL95Jbf0Ag==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"KY55Z43DTV2zD791lECN8Q==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"7dVRd1JQTZWbwdW00Mzllw==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"KeZLGEsESeWcZma4zYprYA==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"iEgEJBmSQy6cak9PmJ9M7g==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"/XYhtStvQJCqsb8Lcwi1ig==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"hz8kZYAkR06BwsrXU2fQkA==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"iBSed5+gQkOcynMFQ1U/4A==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6107d9d5942a4b6254577086"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"IlT1+CVmRDGpZmOtjqtoqw==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"Fragmentation norm and relative quasimorphisms","authors":["Brandenbursky, Michael","Kędra, Jarek"],"date":{"$date":"2018-04-18T00:00:00.000Z"},"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.06592","abstract":" We prove that manifolds with complicated enough fundamental group admit\nmeasure-preserving homeomorphisms which have positive stable fragmentation norm\nwith respect to balls of bounded measure.\n","arxiv_id":"1804.06592","doi":null,"journal_title":null},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"related_articles_were_imported":true,"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-08-02T11:41:09.791Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"ftlJgXFlSFqEMul+RXlojw==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"K0fJ/7XZS/eyv1IWhm6S3w==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"inWNBovzQ0SDbVqp6MxYFw==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"f6CVYbhgQOuvVUBcI3gcnQ==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"QwG9Yt91TlOcz4esrjkXGg==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"yQJ+LfRbTXqkUW6mTPw/TQ==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"kSQ8POASQEekBNcIDM39hA==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"GoO4Wr3vQTCIyWtM5V0TZA==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"+sbhlutoQTKiFNxOrv4MIg==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"MHtb+cvlQ928mwHPfVKx7g==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6107dc40942a4b6254577089"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"pO5YQ9LwQZG9RqQp5Vdecg==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"A glimpse into Thurston's work","authors":["Ohshika, Ken'Ichi","Papadopoulos, Athanase"],"date":{"$date":"2020-09-14T00:00:00.000Z"},"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.06344","abstract":" We present an overview of some significant results of Thurston and their\nimpact on mathematics.

With scant information about a target individual, people can successively forward a message along such a chain. Experimental studies have verified this property in real social networks, and theoretical models have been advanced to explain it. However, existing theoretical models have not been shown to capture behavior in real-world social networks. Here, we introduce a richer model relating geography and social-network friendship, in which the probability of befriending a particular person is inversely proportional to the number of closer people. In a large social network, we show that one-third of the friendships are independent of geography and the remainder exhibit the proposed relationship. Further, we prove analytically that short chains can be discovered in every network exhibiting the relationship.</p>","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1073/pnas.0503018102","journal_title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"related_articles_were_imported":true,"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-08-02T12:00:55.915Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"PpegjJqGSCeoY+VddjuQ9g==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"is5Ld28hSMGZtIzAhHw/mA==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"Wnnm/tTySqm8ekRNNMyXIg==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"lK6wjVugScyJw81o6nHKvQ==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"2fPH1lE4SuKTle7uFrq6OQ==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"8eC4MK1yRYW1783UGV/8XQ==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"xMPdG/7yQ7+zP22y51B6Vw==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"xDnflsLjTuOb+S/QNVPmrg==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"YvyjZ5C0TH+LluQGhlgyWA==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"KXz3kwYfQ3+jYXwqD6s4NQ==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"RkKAEDQtSH6dsMRQVPyHvA==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"RowoFXivR/u+jZW72jPk7g==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"+lCHCA0wS8C0/r/cZAAmaA==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"hIHbAMGYQp+aI9nrFpS3SA==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"Tr5H2XtOQTK2KNawEBvRUQ==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"Ru7XC1dMTmeQR6Xm9icBng==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"0okI9mjuSlmkOHWPY0Qjog==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"+OYh/atMRrSPHVAztcts+g==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"T8pMM6iGTCOT+lGZlNBkeA==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"/WOSwfI7SuCUG+qBDGS6SQ==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"b9L+IbzNTgGVp2lp06XtjA==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"JXqMKlMuQ/CF92R5sq5AYA==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"f/Ben0S3T5SPwR3ymiOXmQ==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"eqR7ihrrTfm/muuTrGQRkQ==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"jTdaGAAtSfqGpFQh3g3tiw==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"FZH4YeexRwC7olkRzvo+vQ==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"XiK1axioQg6se9dbuJ15Kg==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"m5Q9ICobRwytok9bIbr5Mw==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"gdyJDaBdS/eJQuThjShUKA==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"rW2I5HteQcybnSleK3qndA==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"nuIZAZf4Shq6l+uVp5cz6g==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"Qrw1EfPmTzKvCjdiPWCQRg==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"TxE43Mo9S0CgXyl/NE1OIw==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"yMbnZSvKRyWHqGBQEYOoxA==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"zpkMbozLTyuLbBxWFgcQcA==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"Ufjj8n8LS3+j1nNn54bkDw==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"B1b2qVyoRT2VWzr8Y1vKtw==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"MSqE7mVNR+qgRs74dvlDvw==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"Vg6vhn03QNmt6YzNeCEABg==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"RIFlGhtWRFqMfr7/3QHrLg==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"RzidzNNfS7CHzkhmR98Ogw==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"E+w64lBZS4SQkpB0p58Nsg==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6107e2c3942a4b62545770a6"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"Bvz7j0UmTW6hEedkaAIxUg==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"A Computational Complexity-Based Method for Predicting Scholars’ Ages through Articles’ Information","authors":["Zhang, Jun","Su, Xiaoyan","Hou, Mingliang","Ren, Jing"],"date":{"$date":"2021-04-20T00:00:00.000Z"},"pdf_url":"https://downloads.hindawi.com/journals/complexity/2021/6648863.pdf","abstract":"Many scholars have conducted in-depth research on the evaluation and prediction of scholars’ scientific impact and meanwhile discovered various factors that affect the success of scholars. Among all these relevant factors, scholars’ ages have been universally acknowledged as one of the most important factors for it can shed light on many practical issues, e.g., finding supervisors, discovering rising stars, and research funding or award applications. However, due to the inaccessibility or the privacy issues of acquiring scholars’ personal data, there is little research to explore the true ages of scholars currently. Alternatively, scholars’ publications’ information can be obtained through various digital libraries. Inspired by this fact, we propose a novel scholar’s age prediction method based on their articles’ information. Our method first classifies factors that affect scholars’ ages into intuitive and complex types according to their computational complexity and then apply machine learning algorithms to predict the ages of scholars based on these factors. The experimental results on the real dataset demonstrate that our method can effectively predict the true ages of scholars. Given that there is no completely accurate dataset because of the continuous publication of academic papers, we then apply our method on the incomplete dataset. Nevertheless, our method still has high prediction accuracy in such situations.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"https://doi.org/10.1155/2021/6648863","journal_title":"Complexity"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"related_articles_were_imported":false,"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-08-02T12:19:15.583Z"},"cited_articles":[]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6107e69e942a4b62545770b1"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"yUTI1qfqQlOVbuzssXtZuw==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"Discovery and tracking of temporal topics of interest based on belief-function and aging theories","authors":["Sendi, Mondher","Omri, Mohamed Nazih","Abed, Mourad"],"date":{"$date":"2019-09-02T00:00:00.000Z"},"pdf_url":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s12652-018-1050-6.pdf","abstract":"Content-based microblogging networks like Twitter have a significant and fast evolution of the information amount.

This method provides a list of recommendations for target attributes based on community detection and known user attributes and links. Considering the recommendation list and published user information that may be exploited by the attacker to infer other sensitive information of users and threaten users’ privacy, we propose the CDAI (Infer Attributes based on Community Detection) method, which finds a balance between utility and privacy and provides users with safer recommendations.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"https://doi.org/10.1155/2018/3530123","journal_title":"Security and Communication Networks"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"related_articles_were_imported":false,"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-08-02T12:52:42.636Z"},"cited_articles":[]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6107eecdb023a101bc07fb24"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"M3fAm1Z/R1qTW+P7lAh9zQ==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"Exploiting ontology information in fuzzy SVM social media profile classification","authors":["Olfa Mabrouk","Lobna Hlaoua","M.

These can have a negative impact on several areas and on our minds, hence on our behavior. It is obvious that this disinformation is closely related to the profiles of the authors of this information. The purpose of author profiling is to analyze the texts published by the authors in order to determine their profile category. A wide range of methods for selecting statistical characteristics and machine learning has been studied in recent years in order to automatically classify this information. However, these main methods of selecting statistical characteristics and machine learning used for this purpose have not proven their great performance in the processing of data from social networks. The main contribution of this article consists in integrating the semantic component, which has not been taken into account in the main approaches studied in the literature, as additional functionalities enabling the identification of relevant information. Our hypothesis is that the concepts and the relationships between these concepts tend to have a more coherent correlation with relevant and irrelevant information, and can therefore increase the discriminating power of classifiers. The semantic approach proposed revolves around an ontology combined with the linear SVM classifier and then with the fuzzy SVM classifier. The experimental study carried out, on the different collections of Twitter profiles. On our approach and on the main approaches to the literature that we have studied, as well as the analysis of the results obtained.

The CPI model also provides a common framework to accommodate multiple types of user behaviors. Unlike the other models, CPI does not assume a hierarchical relationship between personal interest and community interest, i.e., one is determined purely based on the other. We build the CPI model based on the principle that a user’s personal interest is different from that of her community. We further develop a regularization technique to bias the model to learn more socially meaningful topics for each community. Our experiments on a Twitter dataset show that the CPI model outperforms other state-of-the-art models in topic learning and user classification tasks. We also demonstrate that the CPI model can effectively mine community interest through some representative case examples.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1007/978-3-319-18038-0_55","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"related_articles_were_imported":false,"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-08-02T13:10:39.129Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"547YxshSTvSre9siclIe+w==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6107eecfb023a101bc07fb29"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"QXVwdcd1Rzqc8Y5i82ljlg==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"Inferring user interests in the Twitter social network","authors":["P.

This methodology is a sharp departure from the traditional techniques of inferring interests of a user from the tweets that she posts or receives. We show that the topics of interest inferred by the proposed methodology are far superior than the topics extracted by state-of-the-art techniques such as using topic models (Labeled LDA) on tweets. Based upon the proposed methodology, we build a system Who Likes What, which can infer the interests of millions of Twitter users.

In this study, we integrate qualitative user-marketer interaction content data from a fan page brand community on Facebook and consumer transactions data to assemble a unique data set at the individual consumer level. We then quantify the impact of community contents from consumers (user-generated content, i.e., UGC) and marketers (marketer-generated content, i.e., MGC) on consumers' apparel purchase expenditures. A content analysis method was used to construct measures to capture the informative and persuasive nature of UGC and MGC while distinguishing between directed and undirected communication modes in the brand community. In our empirical analysis, we exploit differences across consumers' fan page joining decision and across timing differences in fan page joining dates for our model estimation and identification strategies. Importantly, we also control for potential self-selection biases and relevant factors such as pricing, promotion, social network attributes, consumer demographics, and unobserved heterogeneity. Our findings show that engagement in social media brand communities leads to a positive increase in purchase expenditures. Additional examinations of UGC and MGC impacts show evidence of social media contents affecting consumer purchase behavior through embedded information and persuasion. We also uncover the different roles played by UGC and MGC, which vary by the type of directed or undirected communication modes by consumers and the marketer. Specifically, the elasticities of demand with respect to UGC information richness are 0.006 (directed communication) and 3.140 (undirected communication), whereas those for MGC information richness are insignificant. Moreover, the UGC valence elasticity of demand is 0.180 (undirected communication), whereas that for MGC valence is 0.004 (directed communication). Overall, UGC exhibits a stronger impact than MGC on consumer purchase behavior. Our findings provide various implications for academic research and practice.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.2139/SSRN.2048614","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"related_articles_were_imported":false,"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-08-02T13:10:39.335Z"},"cited_articles":[]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6107eecfb023a101bc07fb2b"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"JuX071V+QA6cACfuIsHa/g==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"Predicting user personality by mining social interactions in Facebook","authors":["A.

However, on one hand, it would be desirable to obtain the user personality as unobtrusively as possible, yet without compromising the reliability of the model built.

A common challenge across these tasks is identifying user interests from tweets. Semantic enrichment of Twitter posts, to determine user interests, has been an active area of research in the recent past. These approaches typically use available public knowledge-bases (such as Wikipedia) to spot entities and create entity-based user profiles. However, exploitation of such knowledge-bases to create richer user profiles is yet to be explored. In this work, we leverage hierarchical relationships present in knowledge-bases to infer user interests expressed as a Hierarchical Interest Graph. We argue that the hierarchical semantics of concepts can enhance existing systems to personalize or recommend items based on a varied level of conceptual abstractness. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through a user study which shows an average of approximately eight of the top ten weighted hierarchical interests in the graph being relevant to a user’s interests.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1007/978-3-319-07443-6_8","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"related_articles_were_imported":false,"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-08-02T13:10:39.637Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"6LsRacuvQM+7IYUoljKapQ==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"547YxshSTvSre9siclIe+w==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6107eecfb023a101bc07fb2d"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"j4UtN/oHTRO+aoUedsW43A==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"Discovering and Characterizing Places of Interest Using Flickr and Twitter","authors":["Steven Van Canneyt","S.

More specifically, if F is a fuzzy subset of a universe of discourse U = {u} which is characterized by its membership function μF, then a proposition of the form “X is F”, where X is a variable taking values in U, induces a possibility distribution tx which equates the possibility of X taking the value u to μF(u)—the compatibility of u with F. In this way, X becomes a fuzzy variable which is associated with the possibility distribution tx in much the same way as a random variable is associated with a probability distribution. In general, a variable may be associated both with a possibility distribution and a probability distribution, with the weak connection between the two expressed as the possibility/probability consistency principle. \n \nA thesis advanced in this paper is that the imprecision that is intrinsic in natural languages is, in the main, possibilistic rather than probabilistic in nature. Thus, by employing the concept of a possibility distribution, a proposition, p, in a natural language may be translated into a procedure which computes the probability distribution of a set of attributes which are implied by p. Several types of conditional translation rules are discussed and, in particular, a translation rule for propositions of the form “X is F is α-possible”, where α is a number in the interval [0,1], is formulated and illustrated by examples.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1016/S0165-0114(99)80004-9","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"related_articles_were_imported":false,"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-08-02T13:10:40.460Z"},"cited_articles":[]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6107eed1b023a101bc07fb33"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"IzS0ukVRRKCpfs7DZHqa4w==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"Tag-based social interest discovery","authors":["Xin Li","Lei Guo","Y.

Among others, discovering social interests shared by groups of users is very important because it helps to connect people with common interests and encourages people to contribute and share more contents. The main challenge to solving this problem comes from the difficulty of detecting and representing the interest of the users. The existing approaches are all based on the online connections of users and so unable to identify the common interest of users who have no online connections.\n In this paper, we propose a novel social interest discovery approach based on user-generated tags. Our approach is motivated by the key observation that in a social network, human users tend to use descriptive tags to annotate the contents that they are interested in. Our analysis on a large amount of real-world traces reveals that in general, user-generated tags are consistent with the web content they are attached to, while more concise and closer to the understanding and judgments of human users about the content. Thus, patterns of frequent co-occurrences of user tags can be used to characterize and capture topics of user interests. We have developed an Internet Social Interest Discovery system, ISID, to discover the common user interests and cluster users and their saved URLs by different interest topics. Our evaluation shows that ISID can effectively cluster similar documents by interest topics and discover user communities with common interests no matter if they have any online connections.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1145/1367497.1367589","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"related_articles_were_imported":false,"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-08-02T13:10:41.001Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"547YxshSTvSre9siclIe+w==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"Ob7bWyEARWeOir4GKR6Ldw==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6107eed1b023a101bc07fb34"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"ncdl+y9USJqjZiTL6Y9ljg==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"On the quality of inferring interests from social neighbors","authors":["Zhen Wen","Ching-Yung Lin"],"date":{"$date":"2010-08-02T00:00:00.000Z"},"pdf_url":"http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1835853","abstract":"","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1145/1835804.1835853","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"related_articles_were_imported":false,"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-08-02T13:10:41.277Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"yUTI1qfqQlOVbuzssXtZuw==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"SyG/06NNR92F0T8Je/TaBw==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"547YxshSTvSre9siclIe+w==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"ELnBwZJoRjOk8D8yh9mczw==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6107eed1b023a101bc07fb35"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"RlwFiYWZSpeEP/v5htryuA==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"Possibilistic logic: a retrospective and prospective view","authors":["D.

Standard possibilistic logic expressions are classical logic formulas associated with weights, interpreted in the framework of possibility theory as lower bounds of necessity degrees. Possibilistic logic handles partial inconsistency since an inconsistency level can be computed for each possibilistic logic base. Logical formulas with a weight strictly greater than this level are immune to inconsistency and can be safely used in deductive reasoning. This paper first recalls the basic features of possibilistic logic, including information fusion operations. Then, several extensions that mainly deal with the nature and the handling of the weights attached to formulas, are suggested or surveyed: the leximin-based comparison of proofs, the use of partially ordered scales for the weights, or the management of fuzzily restricted variables. Inference principles that are more powerful than the basic possibilistic inference in case of inconsistency are also briefly considered. The interest of a companion logic, based on the notion of guaranteed possibility functions, and working in a way opposite to the one of usual logic, is also emphasized. Its joint use with standard possibilistic logic is briefly discussed. This position paper stresses the main ideas only and refers to previous published literature for technical details.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1016/j.fss.2003.10.011","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"related_articles_were_imported":false,"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-08-02T13:10:41.413Z"},"cited_articles":[]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6107eed1b023a101bc07fb36"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"1XeKShkZREWYy8+aiagKXw==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"Tweet Relevance Based on the Theory of Possibility","authors":["Amina Ben Meriem","Lobna Hlaoua","L.

Thus the new challenges of information research and data mining are to extract and analyze this mass of information which can then be used in different applications. This information is characterized mainly by incompleteness, imprecision, and heterogeneity. Indeed the task of analysis using models based on statistics and word frequencies is crucial. To solve the problem of uncertainty, the possibility theory turns out to be the most adequate. In this article, we propose a new approach to find relevant short texts such as tweets using the dual possibility and necessity. Our goal is to translate the fact that a tweet can only be relevant if there is not only a semantic relationship between the tweet and the query but also a synergy between the terms of the tweet. We have modeled the problem through a possibility network to measure the possibility of the relevance of terms in relation to a concept of a given query and a necessity network to measure the representativeness of terms in a tweet. The evaluation shows that using the theory of possibilities with a set of concepts relevant to an initial query gives the best precision rate compared to other approaches.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1007/978-3-030-63820-7_17","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"related_articles_were_imported":false,"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-08-02T13:10:41.485Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"547YxshSTvSre9siclIe+w==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6107eed1b023a101bc07fb37"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"/CUKU2FGTE2WDoB5X0mBLg==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"TwiNER: named entity recognition in targeted twitter stream","authors":["Chenliang Li","J.

Targeted Twitter stream is usually constructed by filtering tweets with user-defined selection criteria e.g. tweets published by users from a selected region, or tweets that match one or more predefined keywords. Targeted Twitter stream is then monitored to collect and understand users' opinions about the organizations. There is an emerging need for early crisis detection and response with such target stream. Such applications require a good named entity recognition (NER) system for Twitter, which is able to automatically discover emerging named entities that is potentially linked to the crisis. In this paper, we present a novel 2-step unsupervised NER system for targeted Twitter stream, called TwiNER. In the first step, it leverages on the global context obtained from Wikipedia and Web N-Gram corpus to partition tweets into valid segments (phrases) using a dynamic programming algorithm. Each such tweet segment is a candidate named entity. It is observed that the named entities in the targeted stream usually exhibit a gregarious property, due to the way the targeted stream is constructed. In the second step, TwiNER constructs a random walk model to exploit the gregarious property in the local context derived from the Twitter stream. The highly-ranked segments have a higher chance of being true named entities. We evaluated TwiNER on two sets of real-life tweets simulating two targeted streams. Evaluated using labeled ground truth, TwiNER achieves comparable performance as with conventional approaches in both streams. Various settings of TwiNER have also been examined to verify our global context + local context combo idea.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1145/2348283.2348380","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"related_articles_were_imported":false,"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-08-02T13:10:41.580Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"jExnMv8yQ7e+kvueymf3cw==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"547YxshSTvSre9siclIe+w==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6107eed1b023a101bc07fb38"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"NsLVPN7xSZCovjLG32x2tg==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"You are who you know: inferring user profiles in online social networks","authors":["A.

Such profile information is used on the sites as a basis for grouping users, for sharing content, and for suggesting users who may benefit from interaction. However, in practice, not all users provide these attributes.\n In this paper, we ask the question: given attributes for some fraction of the users in an online social network, can we infer the attributes of the remaining users? In other words, can the attributes of users, in combination with the social network graph, be used to predict the attributes of another user in the network? To answer this question, we gather fine-grained data from two social networks and try to infer user profile attributes. We find that users with common attributes are more likely to be friends and often form dense communities, and we propose a method of inferring user attributes that is inspired by previous approaches to detecting communities in social networks. Our results show that certain user attributes can be inferred with high accuracy when given information on as little as 20% of the users.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1145/1718487.1718519","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"related_articles_were_imported":false,"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-08-02T13:10:41.682Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"DHJtjx6PS1aZ4tiT2MX0gg==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"0TJDQaGUTS+ftv0UNaxX6A==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"+hTjzb/8TgeLBvM9T/6QbQ==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"fDfDcLPFQuKHj9mKpGlB+Q==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"H4VF5wLTS4iyc0/7vBUBvA==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"yUTI1qfqQlOVbuzssXtZuw==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"xlWgWPliQlaj5iSLFaODpg==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"edOjCTvhS6mI5GSgWayfIA==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"VvPRe9QeS/GeUg7DLVuPaA==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"d8edC5lKQL2UcBDwrNPfEw==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"y9IECsq8SOagFqVCFDeDAw==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"yVqv6j24SZmoqY4G0ICicg==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"6y3AjgHQSSu7Hhe/xiC8ZQ==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"WZwlMVVrRXil4tlM8iXc5Q==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"FXOhN0RCTFSK/MQWQeew2g==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"RYameQnGTaWLx2vs/MJGtQ==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"RWDE40DmQDWRX0YUB7dy+Q==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"Z4JiVfKFRrCzz0VV2KaZVQ==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"dD62V707RgOtDk7GBaYrpA==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"ZUoxWxdBQ76wZXQoFj42gA==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"mmAYj2iNTwOPZxIBHS9itA==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"45w4Yqu6SNmwSV2Rx/fALQ==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"s/ZjIsTKQdWb7lVyatA+Vg==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"fz1bbWfxS4yDweiWu1EtjA==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"Q4KCxuFaTmObaTHWlfcpAw==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"0N3VmiEnQTWPWzOnD9BCow==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"+SG+6Kb+R0OpwTUhKpjH/g==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"iq67zbRYST6f0Q9hkxMbKA==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"C0z1GFApR8awtjVKBSR7wg==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"SyG/06NNR92F0T8Je/TaBw==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"xR1yOQT0QhekGvdXR52WfQ==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"UrjmiHX0SbSwMqZA3tCTQA==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"H9R3FmJvRNWlRVsDtT/FcA==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"Jqhodw0cSGCXBGgxQc9+hg==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"/jaEa2IwRFm9g4z6/cpneA==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"547YxshSTvSre9siclIe+w==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"Va1Vm0T/QSmUHY06gzkRRA==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"cKH6EOUBSx+GIRl7Ulza6A==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"ELnBwZJoRjOk8D8yh9mczw==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"FT2UzP4wSwKSRnTjtCmf+g==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"wRtvSLCXT8uRy8fRLM1q9w==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6107eed2b023a101bc07fb39"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"HYs1CjyMRjKVY6cUkTz9sQ==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"Semantic Sentiment Analysis of Twitter","authors":["Hassan Saif","Yulan He","H.

Recognition and identification of biological entities is a critical step in this process. NLP systems generally rely on nomenclatures and ontological specifications as resources for determining the names of the entities, assigning semantic categories that are consistent with the corresponding ontology, and assignment of identifiers that map to well-defined entities within a particular nomenclature. Although nomenclatures and ontologies are valuable for text processing systems, they were developed to aid researchers and are heterogeneous in structure and semantics. A uniform resource that is automatically generated from diverse resources, and that is designed for NLP purposes would be a useful tool for the field, and would further database interoperability. This paper presents work towards this goal. We have automatically created lexical resources from four model organism nomenclature systems (mouse, fly, worm, and yeast), and have studied performance of the resources within an existing NLP system, GENIES. Using nomenclatures is not straightforward because issues concerning ambiguity, synonymy, and name variations are quite challenging. In this paper we focus mainly on ambiguity. We determined that the number of ambiguous gene names within the individual nomenclatures, across the four nomenclatures, and with general English ranged from 0%-10.18%, 1.187%-20.30%, and 0%-2.49% respectively. When actually processing text, we found the rate of ambiguous occurrences (not counting ambiguities stemming from English words) to range from 2.4%-32.9% depending on the organisms considered.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1142/9789812704856_0023","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"related_articles_were_imported":false,"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-08-02T13:10:49.039Z"},"cited_articles":[]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6107eed9b023a101bc07fb3f"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"CUmEzvKNQo6O6R6oY/OAnQ==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"Pertinent Knowledge Extraction from a Semantic Network: Application of Fuzzy Sets Theory","authors":["M.

OntoSem, an implementation of the theory of ontological semantics under continuous development for over fifteen years, uses a specia lly constructed NLP-oriented ontology and an ontologicalsemantic lexicon to translate English text into a custom ontology-motivated knowledge representation language, the language of text meaning representations (TMRs). OntoSem concentrates on a variety of ambiguity resolution tasks as well as processing unexpected input and reference. To adapt OntoSem’s representation to the Semantic Web, we developed a translation system, OntoSem2OWL, between the TMR language into the Semantic Web language OWL. We next used OntoSem and OntoSem2OWL to support SemNews, an e xperimental web service that monitors RSS news sources, processes the summaries of the news stories and publishes a structured representation of the meaning of the text in the news story.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.4018/jswis.2007100103","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"related_articles_were_imported":false,"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-08-02T13:10:50.488Z"},"cited_articles":[]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6107eee4b023a101bc07fb42"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"t8bp2MTOQFmmrGs2R+nvyw==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"Uncertain String Matching Based on Bitmap Indexing","authors":["Wang Xuan","Chen Ziyang","Wang Ding"],"date":{"$date":"2020-08-02T00:00:00.000Z"},"pdf_url":"http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3384007","abstract":"String matching was a basic issue in computer science.

Considering specialty of the sequence data in bioinformatics, we design an indexing structure based on adjacency list. Greedy and range maximum query techniques were combined to realize Greedy Uncertain String Matching (GUSM) algorithm. To achieve further speed-up matching and reduce index space, adjacency list structure was mapped into bitmap indexing. Based on it, Bitmap Uncertain String Matching(BUSM) was proposed to improve matching effectively.

Understanding a users’ domain (s) of interest is a significant step towards addressing their domain-based trustworthiness through an accurate understanding of their content in their OSNs.,This study uses a Twitter mining approach for domain-based classification of users and their textual content. The proposed approach incorporates machine learning modules. The approach comprises two analysis phases: the time-aware semantic analysis of users’ historical content incorporating five commonly used machine learning classifiers. This framework classifies users into two main categories: politics-related and non-politics-related categories. In the second stage, the likelihood predictions obtained in the first phase will be used to predict the domain of future users’ tweets.,Experiments have been conducted to validate the mechanism proposed in the study framework, further supported by the excellent performance of the harnessed evaluation metrics. The experiments conducted verify the applicability of the framework to an effective domain-based classification for Twitter users and their content, as evident in the outstanding results of several performance evaluation metrics.,This study is limited to an on/off domain classification for content of OSNs. Hence, we have selected a politics domain because of Twitter’s popularity as an opulent source of political deliberations. Such data abundance facilitates data aggregation and improves the results of the data analysis. Furthermore, the currently implemented machine learning approaches assume that uncertainty and incompleteness do not affect the accuracy of the Twitter classification. In fact, data uncertainty and incompleteness may exist. In the future, the authors will formulate the data uncertainty and incompleteness into fuzzy numbers which can be used to address imprecise, uncertain and vague data.,This study proposes a practical framework comprising significant implications for a variety of business-related applications, such as the voice of customer/voice of market, recommendation systems, the discovery of domain-based influencers and opinion mining through tracking and simulation. In particular, the factual grasp of the domains of interest extracted at the user level or post level enhances the customer-to-business engagement. This contributes to an accurate analysis of customer reviews and opinions to improve brand loyalty, customer service, etc.,This paper fills a gap in the existing literature by presenting a consolidated framework for Twitter mining that aims to uncover the deficiency of the current state-of-the-art approaches to topic distillation and domain discovery. The overall approach is promising in the fortification of Twitter mining towards a better understanding of users’ domains of interest.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1108/JKM-11-2016-0489","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"related_articles_were_imported":false,"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-08-02T13:11:02.316Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"547YxshSTvSre9siclIe+w==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6107eee6b023a101bc07fb45"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"FhuWUt/tSc6/6ds4wQwkpQ==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"Fuzzy Twin SVM based-Profile Categorization approach","authors":["Olfa Mabrouk","Lobna Hlaoua","M.

Ordinarily, the connection topology is assumed to be either completely regular or completely random. But many biological, technological and social networks lie somewhere between these two extremes. Here we explore simple models of networks that can be tuned through this middle ground: regular networks ‘rewired’ to introduce increasing amounts of disorder. We find that these systems can be highly clustered, like regular lattices, yet have small characteristic path lengths, like random graphs. We call them ‘small-world’ networks, by analogy with the small-world phenomenon, (popularly known as six degrees of separation). The neural network of the worm Caenorhabditis elegans, the power grid of the western United States, and the collaboration graph of film actors are shown to be small-world networks. Models of dynamical systems with small-world coupling display enhanced signal-propagation speed, computational power, and synchronizability. In particular, infectious diseases spread more easily in small-world networks than in regular lattices.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1038/30918","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"related_articles_were_imported":false,"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-08-02T13:11:03.116Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"C3tPDxiBQfWqJepaMpuwxA==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"PTht29ljTFCastf2m5m/QQ==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"ulwcNLfzSRupQ323fGKZiA==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"dQ01eAbmQCOzw9UTJo5r8Q==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"w/gzb4Z+RiGpV2mhzoDqbQ==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"EKkY4oXFQQmEdZXF/SjKlQ==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"W/6xslt8RmGBcD6AAISJ9A==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"F8Th+kaqQduflzlG/Fn8bQ==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"P9qI1THwS4mnE3L1hVM3hg==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"hr7a+RU1RCqyODQBGkAdSw==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"/voG7/m3Tjug4jw8i/JEew==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"wsB04upDRf6y4MNh1uPqYQ==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"RTOEyAhgT5+pSu34mhZArg==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"Va1Vm0T/QSmUHY06gzkRRA==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"82cI0jikRk++Enwi+XoI7Q==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"7QiELvIIQlOf5Ax8Bch0Sg==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"8QtWCx9XTEWYeZi81qx/9A==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"4iTPGEygRAOoWUIGIfLmug==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"g5Bn+P7ZSry7SQK53+OUgQ==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"qjeTdeV2SbmADyj4oe7Z7A==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"CxTTCwcETyiwqzjf4GmKmg==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"sGwkZK/jS86j+pUTnAClnQ==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"4xX4f21kSmipJM4a/HY29A==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"rN/fFX9HSP6P8FFYO2fqxw==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"sSuDdGH4SniD1NMNzO8xtg==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"Amt58nJsTHaqBo8XQND5Mw==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"f72LoWaSTuqBXvas6lHUFw==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"havxlzM/TseQ4oUJGugQgQ==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"hLeihc2YSWmpjuIQTPo7ww==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"iey7ryJdRRG5mcYEZ7vRYg==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"WLKBoBC5RJGRdX6imuksgQ==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"JCDzdZSYR2OLKD01yZTzGg==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"VLiwSh2dS8SrZrtPCv6fWw==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"GT4YjalER8GYzmmNDe2P2g==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"7xuscHzKSZ+go19okOSBKQ==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"vbeWEPG6SpmgCNrXpK4QoQ==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"sVuQLGmHQ+aq3WmFZrXD/g==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"6hwRlWD6SXeR+r+/pwvNVw==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"3sfG4WVRTc2AkGuM4CRklg==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"wYpFgYV6Szeqcb4MTbqeHg==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"cgPKiio3TimuL1ETVaNVxQ==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"2fPH1lE4SuKTle7uFrq6OQ==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"8eC4MK1yRYW1783UGV/8XQ==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"7962mWoIQJGB3DW7Tcs+Kw==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"HjsDfKc7QuKBIkER7aHg+w==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"PhupTdqGTdahZhyUvS2JGQ==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6107eee7b023a101bc07fb48"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"vxDE92o/TsC9tNyscA8e5g==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"Random graph models of social networks","authors":["M.

S. college students with over 90% active participation among undergraduates [5, 16].","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1007/978-1-84628-905-7_3","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"related_articles_were_imported":false,"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-08-02T13:11:03.861Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"Wnnm/tTySqm8ekRNNMyXIg==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"Va1Vm0T/QSmUHY06gzkRRA==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"mfs0zojOQP+ZwpuskYgkkw==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"5b0QiHUjReukRUvLo0fQ9w==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"xDnflsLjTuOb+S/QNVPmrg==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"YvyjZ5C0TH+LluQGhlgyWA==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"KXz3kwYfQ3+jYXwqD6s4NQ==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"rDkJYE4jSqi7wnpMcYg2RQ==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"C3xgphJ7SZaBYyG1pqK0Zw==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"EPRRjhmaQM+ZJ2RXRdA/fg==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6107eee8b023a101bc07fb4c"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"lK6wjVugScyJw81o6nHKvQ==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"Group formation in large social networks: membership, growth, and evolution","authors":["L.

In the digital domain, on-line groups are becoming increasingly prominent due to the growth of community and social networking sites such as MySpace and LiveJournal. However, the challenge of collecting and analyzing large-scale time-resolved data on social groups and communities has left most basic questions about the evolution of such groups largely unresolved: what are the structural features that influence whether individuals will join communities, which communities will grow rapidly, and how do the overlaps among pairs of communities change over time.Here we address these questions using two large sources of data: friendship links and community membership on LiveJournal, and co-authorship and conference publications in DBLP. Both of these datasets provide explicit user-defined communities, where conferences serve as proxies for communities in DBLP. We study how the evolution of these communities relates to properties such as the structure of the underlying social networks. We find that the propensity of individuals to join communities, and of communities to grow rapidly, depends in subtle ways on the underlying network structure. For example, the tendency of an individual to join a community is influenced not just by the number of friends he or she has within the community, but also crucially by how those friends are connected to one another. We use decision-tree techniques to identify the most significant structural determinants of these properties. We also develop a novel methodology for measuring movement of individuals between communities, and show how such movements are closely aligned with changes in the topics of interest within the communities.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1145/1150402.1150412","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"related_articles_were_imported":false,"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-08-02T13:11:04.300Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"Wnnm/tTySqm8ekRNNMyXIg==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"6LsRacuvQM+7IYUoljKapQ==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"XsSBVlg0QuKI7zzZ5CgJeQ==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"x7uQ68DBTkuXhQHaiZdvkQ==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"O51KCy8mS6msdDvXdj3TvQ==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"Va1Vm0T/QSmUHY06gzkRRA==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"8eC4MK1yRYW1783UGV/8XQ==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"VWesljZaT5CLLb5eCRL+xQ==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"W++IgNxBSMKsLfSS5OKryA==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"g5Bn+P7ZSry7SQK53+OUgQ==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"TrXOmsGqREmDdl6wMlTo/A==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"9oEAkfMyTbyqSUBUeaPxfw==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"NT+w+AmDSOqeurdw1UQ/YQ==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"iMEw7bnvQ8e7bjXoeVu92Q==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"6LLKbpTdSLG2n5xuI6iflw==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"vyAJ+1hZSZ2f4nM0uyOtnQ==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6107eee8b023a101bc07fb4d"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"8vppmahXR/yY23268B3Wqg==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"Empirical Analysis of an Evolving Social Network","authors":["Gueorgi Kossinets","D.

Mutual information (MI) has been frequently utilized for capturing the complete dependence structure including nonlinear dependence. Recently, several methods have been proposed for the MI estimation, such as kernel density estimators (KDEs), k -nearest neighbors (KNNs), Edgeworth approximation of differential entropy, and adaptive partitioning of the XY plane. However, outstanding gaps in the current literature have precluded the ability to effectively automate these methods, which, in turn, have caused limited adoptions by the application communities. This study attempts to address a key gap in the literature-specifically, the evaluation of the above methods to choose the best method, particularly in terms of their robustness for short and noisy data, based on comparisons with the theoretical MI estimates, which can be computed analytically, as well with linear correlation and Kendall's tau . Here we consider smaller data sizes, such as 50, 100, and 1000, and within this study we characterize 50 and 100 data points as very short and 1000 as short. We consider a broader class of functions, specifically linear, quadratic, periodic, and chaotic, contaminated with artificial noise with varying noise-to-signal ratios. Our results indicate KDEs as the best choice for very short data at relatively high noise-to-signal levels whereas the performance of KNNs is the best for very short data at relatively low noise levels as well as for short data consistently across noise levels. In addition, the optimal smoothing parameter of a Gaussian kernel appears to be the best choice for KDEs while three nearest neighbors appear optimal for KNNs. Thus, in situations where the approximate data sizes are known in advance and exploratory data analysis and/or domain knowledge can be used to provide a priori insights into the noise-to-signal ratios, the results in the paper point to a way forward for automating the process of MI estimation.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1103/PHYSREVE.76.026209","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"related_articles_were_imported":false,"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-08-02T13:11:04.690Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"0b8q2XIYS2mnih8EzCEf7Q==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6107eee9b023a101bc07fb50"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"8eC4MK1yRYW1783UGV/8XQ==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"Measurement and analysis of online social networks","authors":["A.

Users of these sites form a social network, which provides a powerful means of sharing, organizing, and finding content and contacts. The popularity of these sites provides an opportunity to study the characteristics of online social network graphs at large scale. Understanding these graphs is important, both to improve current systems and to design new applications of online social networks.\n This paper presents a large-scale measurement study and analysis of the structure of multiple online social networks. We examine data gathered from four popular online social networks: Flickr, YouTube, LiveJournal, and Orkut. We crawled the publicly accessible user links on each site, obtaining a large portion of each social network's graph. Our data set contains over 11.3 million users and 328 million links. We believe that this is the first study to examine multiple online social networks at scale.\n Our results confirm the power-law, small-world, and scale-free properties of online social networks. We observe that the indegree of user nodes tends to match the outdegree; that the networks contain a densely connected core of high-degree nodes; and that this core links small groups of strongly clustered, low-degree nodes at the fringes of the network. Finally, we discuss the implications of these structural properties for the design of social network based systems.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1145/1298306.1298311","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"related_articles_were_imported":false,"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-08-02T13:11:05.104Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"uLK9FGVDTHGndq3Y6BDNwg==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"eMf8UQytS1WfNNBfwtb8JQ==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"jS4wMjJWTb2Zu0i1bDLLOQ==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"NsLVPN7xSZCovjLG32x2tg==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"45w4Yqu6SNmwSV2Rx/fALQ==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"Va1Vm0T/QSmUHY06gzkRRA==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"mfs0zojOQP+ZwpuskYgkkw==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"7962mWoIQJGB3DW7Tcs+Kw==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"x+R3js0uR8C7hFRBhJYIzA==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"qfQJvh23Skqp1230vy1mPw==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"xDnflsLjTuOb+S/QNVPmrg==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"HRsYOYK2QuC698FSYbxmfw==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"HjsDfKc7QuKBIkER7aHg+w==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"EUnHkAgQQ2mQ2uj/UQdrzg==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"YJjauIipRoiFJFzs7WUEDg==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"YvyjZ5C0TH+LluQGhlgyWA==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"b9R/L6AjSkqbQKzvvP2NEg==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"VWesljZaT5CLLb5eCRL+xQ==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"IKBtxhgtTpS91ZDHpZkOyQ==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"rppGbfrTTk+ZkvRuLES5ew==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"yJVL3qy1ToqhX9mzbb0Uxw==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"xOKv3XJbSNOlYiUG3kcayA==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"Tta4/Iv5S2+nBxadVXSKTg==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"RCZvc1FiT+6K5MZ6SVltZw==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"KXz3kwYfQ3+jYXwqD6s4NQ==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"j6sYtJ60SuCU2zcKig5zgw==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"vBG59RutQz2EvFZIs7j2XA==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"rDkJYE4jSqi7wnpMcYg2RQ==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"4xX4f21kSmipJM4a/HY29A==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"9oEAkfMyTbyqSUBUeaPxfw==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"3sfG4WVRTc2AkGuM4CRklg==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"/sutvEkVS5ysZWx20bdt/A==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"whp6MepuSXCV0XTo+zPifw==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"8WClJtyeTJWfNLSlK/8Y+g==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"qMaK7Q+iQXmABiszfRmaOA==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"kIig7CYWQ2mEw7ws/fWYQQ==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"8o7L6LFCSdG7+/bs6q0fgw==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"NLVDNCaXSpmuj8BsKA+hrw==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"8Et7kbbHTTyny8RVN1hKQA==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"6LLKbpTdSLG2n5xuI6iflw==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6107eee9b023a101bc07fb51"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"BeaPjA5xSBScytzWfyeYUw==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"The link-prediction problem for social networks","authors":["D.

We have access to complete data of Cyworld's ilchon (friend) relationships and analyze its degree distribution, clustering property, degree correlation, and evolution over time. We also use Cyworld data to evaluate the validity of snowball sampling method, which we use to crawl and obtain partial network topologies of MySpace and orkut. Cyworld, the oldest of the three, demonstrates a changing scaling behavior over time in degree distribution. The latest Cyworld data's degree distribution exhibits a multi-scaling behavior, while those of MySpace and orkut have simple scaling behaviors with different exponents. Very interestingly, each of the two e ponents corresponds to the different segments in Cyworld's degree distribution.

Users interact through various features of online social networking services: making friend relationships, sharing their photos, and writing comments. These friend relationships are expected to become a key to many other features in web services, such as recommendation engines, security measures, online search, and personalization issues. However, we have very limited knowledge on how much interaction actually takes place over friend relationships declared online. A friend relationship only marks the beginning of online interaction.\n Does the interaction between users follow the declaration of friend relationship? Does a user interact evenly or lopsidedly with friends? We venture to answer these questions in this work. We construct a network from comments written in guestbooks. A node represents a user and a directed edge a comments from a user to another. We call this network an activity network. Previous work on activity networks include phone-call networks [34, 35] and MSN messenger networks [27]. To our best knowledge, this is the first attempt to compare the explicit friend relationship network and implicit activity network.\n We have analyzed structural characteristics of the activity network and compared them with the friends network. Though the activity network is weighted and directed, its structure is similar to the friend relationship network. We report that the in-degree and out-degree distributions are close to each other and the social interaction through the guestbook is highly reciprocated. When we consider only those links in the activity network that are reciprocated, the degree correlation distribution exhibits much more pronounced assortativity than the friends network and places it close to known social networks. The k-core analysis gives yet another corroborating evidence that the friends network deviates from the known social network and has an unusually large number of highly connected cores.\n We have delved into the weighted and directed nature of the activity network, and investigated the reciprocity, disparity, and network motifs. We also have observed that peer pressure to stay active online stops building up beyond a certain number of friends.\n The activity network has shown topological characteristics similar to the friends network, but thanks to its directed and weighted nature, it has allowed us more in-depth analysis of user interaction.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1145/1452520.1452528","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"related_articles_were_imported":false,"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-08-02T13:11:06.434Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"Va1Vm0T/QSmUHY06gzkRRA==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"7962mWoIQJGB3DW7Tcs+Kw==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"qfQJvh23Skqp1230vy1mPw==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"xDnflsLjTuOb+S/QNVPmrg==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"EUnHkAgQQ2mQ2uj/UQdrzg==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"YJjauIipRoiFJFzs7WUEDg==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"YvyjZ5C0TH+LluQGhlgyWA==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"rHlIvmcAQpqqfhtv41ZhhA==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"KXz3kwYfQ3+jYXwqD6s4NQ==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"EPRRjhmaQM+ZJ2RXRdA/fg==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"6LLKbpTdSLG2n5xuI6iflw==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6107eeeab023a101bc07fb54"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"5b0QiHUjReukRUvLo0fQ9w==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"Social Networks that matter: Twitter under the Microscope","authors":["B.

The popularity of these sites offers a unique opportunity to study the dynamics of social networks at scale. Having a proper understanding of how online social networks grow can provide insights into the network structure, allow predictions of future growth, and enable simulation of systems on networks of arbitrary size. However, to date, most empirical studies have focused on static network snapshots rather than growth dynamics.\n In this paper, we collect and examine detailed growth data from the Flickr online social network, focusing on the ways in which new links are formed. Our study makes two contributions. First, we collect detailed data covering three months of growth, encompassing 950,143 new users and over 9.7 million new links, and we make this data available to the research community. Second, we use a first-principles approach to investigate the link formation process. In short, we find that links tend to be created by users who already have many links, that users tend to respond to incoming links by creating links back to the source, and that users link to other users who are already close in the network.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1145/1397735.1397742","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"related_articles_were_imported":false,"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-08-02T13:11:07.133Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"7962mWoIQJGB3DW7Tcs+Kw==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"Va1Vm0T/QSmUHY06gzkRRA==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"HjsDfKc7QuKBIkER7aHg+w==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"YJjauIipRoiFJFzs7WUEDg==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"rppGbfrTTk+ZkvRuLES5ew==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"ilkO6JSoR1CqjvEsRBEc5w==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"FT2UzP4wSwKSRnTjtCmf+g==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"8o7L6LFCSdG7+/bs6q0fgw==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"dUcL1KbWQLCKl72db4C05w==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"8Et7kbbHTTyny8RVN1hKQA==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"CaZ2jQTOSaqEUj4UDNvPHQ==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"6LLKbpTdSLG2n5xuI6iflw==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6107eeebb023a101bc07fb57"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"xilan/IoSyi70MYGdF8p+w==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"Gaydar: Facebook Friendships Expose Sexual Orientation","authors":["C.

After analyzing 4,080 Facebook profiles from the MIT network, we determined that the percentage of a given user's friends who self-identify as gay male is strongly correlated with the sexual orientation of that user, and we developed a logistic regression classifier with strong predictive power.

Teens leveraged these sites for a wide array of everyday social practices - gossiping, flirting, joking around, sharing information, and simply hanging out. While social network sites were predominantly used by teens as a peer-based social outlet, the unchartered nature of these sites generated fear among adults. This dissertation documents my 2.5-year ethnographic study of American teens' engagement with social network sites and the ways in which their participation supported and complicated three practices - self-presentation, peer sociality, and negotiating adult society. My analysis centers on how social network sites can be understood as networked publics which are simultaneously (1) the space constructed through networked technologies and (2) the imagined community that emerges as a result of the intersection of people, technology, and practice. Networked publics support many of the same practices as unmediated publics, but their structural differences often inflect practices in unique ways. Four properties - persistence, searchability, replicability, and scalability - and three dynamics - invisible audiences, collapsed contexts, and the blurring of public and private - are examined and woven throughout the discussion. While teenagers primarily leverage social network sites to engage in common practices, the properties of these sites configured their practices and teens were forced to contend with the resultant dynamics. Often, in doing so, they reworked the technology for their purposes. As teenagers learned to navigate social network sites, they developed potent strategies for managing the complexities of and social awkwardness incurred by these sites. Their strategies reveal how new forms of social media are incorporated into everyday life, complicating some practices and reinforcing others. New technologies reshape public life, but teens' engagement also reconfigures the technology itself.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.2139/ssrn.1344756","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"related_articles_were_imported":false,"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-08-02T13:11:07.989Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"Va1Vm0T/QSmUHY06gzkRRA==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"M/iq47W7SiSTgDEeFr/Qfw==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6107eeecb023a101bc07fb59"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"qfQJvh23Skqp1230vy1mPw==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"On the evolution of user interaction in Facebook","authors":["B.

Users of these networks often establish hundreds to even thousands of social links with other users. Recently, researchers have suggested examining the activity network - a network that is based on the actual interaction between users, rather than mere friendship - to distinguish between strong and weak links. While initial studies have led to insights on how an activity network is structurally different from the social network itself, a natural and important aspect of the activity network has been disregarded: the fact that over time social links can grow stronger or weaker. In this paper, we study the evolution of activity between users in the Facebook social network to capture this notion. We find that links in the activity network tend to come and go rapidly over time, and the strength of ties exhibits a general decreasing trend of activity as the social network link ages. For example, only 30% of Facebook user pairs interact consistently from one month to the next. Interestingly, we also find that even though the links of the activity network change rapidly over time, many graph-theoretic properties of the activity network remain unchanged.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1145/1592665.1592675","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"related_articles_were_imported":false,"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-08-02T13:11:08.168Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"XU2LJJ9LQEiTJCN9MnvjJg==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"BH/pqwvXRDy6NG7SRbbP8Q==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"F8Th+kaqQduflzlG/Fn8bQ==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"Va1Vm0T/QSmUHY06gzkRRA==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"xDnflsLjTuOb+S/QNVPmrg==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"YJjauIipRoiFJFzs7WUEDg==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"YvyjZ5C0TH+LluQGhlgyWA==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"RCZvc1FiT+6K5MZ6SVltZw==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"KXz3kwYfQ3+jYXwqD6s4NQ==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"cKH6EOUBSx+GIRl7Ulza6A==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"j6sYtJ60SuCU2zcKig5zgw==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"ELnBwZJoRjOk8D8yh9mczw==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"9oEAkfMyTbyqSUBUeaPxfw==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"ilkO6JSoR1CqjvEsRBEc5w==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"8o7L6LFCSdG7+/bs6q0fgw==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"zvp4j/TXR8uAM1bE3rrKfw==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"dUcL1KbWQLCKl72db4C05w==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"8Et7kbbHTTyny8RVN1hKQA==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"1PpL03mhSuakvIf3Cx2rJg==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"6LLKbpTdSLG2n5xuI6iflw==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6107eeecb023a101bc07fb5a"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"xDnflsLjTuOb+S/QNVPmrg==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"Characterizing user behavior in online social networks","authors":["Fabrício Benevenuto","Tiago Rodrigues","M.

Our study is based on detailed clickstream data, collected over a 12-day period, summarizing HTTP sessions of 37,024 users who accessed four popular social networks: Orkut, MySpace, Hi5, and LinkedIn. The data were collected from a social network aggregator website in Brazil, which enables users to connect to multiple social networks with a single authentication. Our analysis of the clickstream data reveals key features of the social network workloads, such as how frequently people connect to social networks and for how long, as well as the types and sequences of activities that users conduct on these sites. Additionally, we crawled the social network topology of Orkut, so that we could analyze user interaction data in light of the social graph. Our data analysis suggests insights into how users interact with friends in Orkut, such as how frequently users visit their friends' or non-immediate friends' pages. In summary, our analysis demonstrates the power of using clickstream data in identifying patterns in social network workloads and social interactions. Our analysis shows that browsing, which cannot be inferred from crawling publicly available data, accounts for 92% of all user activities. Consequently, compared to using only crawled data, considering silent interactions like browsing friends' pages increases the measured level of interaction among users.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1145/1644893.1644900","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"related_articles_were_imported":false,"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-08-02T13:11:08.421Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"Va1Vm0T/QSmUHY06gzkRRA==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"EUnHkAgQQ2mQ2uj/UQdrzg==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"YJjauIipRoiFJFzs7WUEDg==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"YvyjZ5C0TH+LluQGhlgyWA==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"7//npzkAQsCqPjsKzaFP/g==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"KXz3kwYfQ3+jYXwqD6s4NQ==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"VV4IbH9bSW++s7omJxdLNw==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"s0QpYGb+TX+IkFgNf0abnw==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"rDkJYE4jSqi7wnpMcYg2RQ==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"EPRRjhmaQM+ZJ2RXRdA/fg==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6107eef0b023a101bc07fb5b"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"HRsYOYK2QuC698FSYbxmfw==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"You are who you know: inferring user profiles in online social networks","authors":["A.

Users in today's online social networks often post a profile, consisting of attributes like geographic location, interests, and schools attended. Such profile information is used on the sites as a basis for grouping users, for sharing content, and for suggesting users who may benefit from interaction. However, in practice, not all users provide these attributes.\n In this paper, we ask the question: given attributes for some fraction of the users in an online social network, can we infer the attributes of the remaining users? In other words, can the attributes of users, in combination with the social network graph, be used to predict the attributes of another user in the network? To answer this question, we gather fine-grained data from two social networks and try to infer user profile attributes. We find that users with common attributes are more likely to be friends and often form dense communities, and we propose a method of inferring user attributes that is inspired by previous approaches to detecting communities in social networks. Our results show that certain user attributes can be inferred with high accuracy when given information on as little as 20% of the users.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1145/1718487.1718519","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"related_articles_were_imported":false,"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-08-02T13:11:12.666Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"DHJtjx6PS1aZ4tiT2MX0gg==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"0TJDQaGUTS+ftv0UNaxX6A==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"+hTjzb/8TgeLBvM9T/6QbQ==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"fDfDcLPFQuKHj9mKpGlB+Q==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"H4VF5wLTS4iyc0/7vBUBvA==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"yUTI1qfqQlOVbuzssXtZuw==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"xlWgWPliQlaj5iSLFaODpg==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"edOjCTvhS6mI5GSgWayfIA==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"VvPRe9QeS/GeUg7DLVuPaA==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"d8edC5lKQL2UcBDwrNPfEw==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"y9IECsq8SOagFqVCFDeDAw==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"yVqv6j24SZmoqY4G0ICicg==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"6y3AjgHQSSu7Hhe/xiC8ZQ==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"WZwlMVVrRXil4tlM8iXc5Q==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"FXOhN0RCTFSK/MQWQeew2g==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"RYameQnGTaWLx2vs/MJGtQ==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"RWDE40DmQDWRX0YUB7dy+Q==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"Z4JiVfKFRrCzz0VV2KaZVQ==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"dD62V707RgOtDk7GBaYrpA==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6107eef1b023a101bc07fb5c"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"HjsDfKc7QuKBIkER7aHg+w==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"Measurement-calibrated graph models for social network experiments","authors":["A.

In this article we present a large-scale measurement analysis of user behavior in some popular OSNs: Bebo, MySpace, Netlog, and Tagged. A measurement framework has been created in order to observe user activity: more than 500 PlanetLab nodes across the globe have been used for our measurement, monitoring more than 80,000 users for six weeks by downloading more than 100 million profile pages. Based on the measurements, we address two key issues of online social networks: characterization of user activities and usage patterns in the examined OSNs. The main findings of the article include that users' online time spending can be modeled with Weibull distributions; soon after subscribing, a fraction of users tend to lose interest surprisingly fast; and the duration of OSN users' online sessions shows power law distribution characteristics.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1109/MNET.2010.5578915","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"related_articles_were_imported":false,"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-08-02T13:11:14.958Z"},"cited_articles":[]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6107eef3b023a101bc07fb5e"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"YJjauIipRoiFJFzs7WUEDg==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"Understanding latent interactions in online social networks","authors":["Jing Jiang","Christo Wilson","Xiao Wang","Wenpeng Sha","Peng Huang","Yafei Dai","Ben Y.

A deep understanding of user interactions in OSNs can provide important insights into questions of human social behavior and into the design of social platforms and applications. However, recent studies have shown that a majority of user interactions on OSNs are latent interactions, that is, passive actions, such as profile browsing, that cannot be observed by traditional measurement techniques.\n In this article, we seek a deeper understanding of both active and latent user interactions in OSNs. For quantifiable data on latent user interactions, we perform a detailed measurement study on Renren, the largest OSN in China with more than 220 million users to date. All friendship links in Renren are public, allowing us to exhaustively crawl a connected graph component of 42 million users and 1.66 billion social links in 2009. Renren also keeps detailed, publicly viewable visitor logs for each user profile. We capture detailed histories of profile visits over a period of 90 days for users in the Peking University Renren network and use statistics of profile visits to study issues of user profile popularity, reciprocity of profile visits, and the impact of content updates on user popularity. We find that latent interactions are much more prevalent and frequent than active events, are nonreciprocal in nature, and that profile popularity is correlated with page views of content rather than with quantity of content updates. Finally, we construct latent interaction graphs as models of user browsing behavior and compare their structural properties, evolution, community structure, and mixing times against those of both active interaction graphs and social graphs.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1145/2517040","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"related_articles_were_imported":false,"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-08-02T13:11:15.112Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"TL/sEc3NR56EJMBpsiw6rg==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"Va1Vm0T/QSmUHY06gzkRRA==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"YvyjZ5C0TH+LluQGhlgyWA==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"KXz3kwYfQ3+jYXwqD6s4NQ==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"VV4IbH9bSW++s7omJxdLNw==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"s0QpYGb+TX+IkFgNf0abnw==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"7//OnLM+RuKmLwLJcOYgpg==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"NLVDNCaXSpmuj8BsKA+hrw==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6107eef3b023a101bc07fb5f"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"BHuKbEDqRWmUF9teC+pL+w==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"Scramble!

In this paper, we present an in-depth analysis of user workloads in online social networks. This study is based on detailed clickstream data, collected over a 12-day period, summarizing HTTP sessions of 37,024 users who accessed four popular social networks: Orkut, MySpace, Hi5, and LinkedIn. The data were collected from a social network aggregator website in Brazil, which enables users to connect to multiple social networks with a single authentication. Our analysis of the clickstream data reveals key features of the social network workloads, such as how frequently people connect to social networks and for how long, as well as the types and sequences of activities that users conduct on these sites. Additionally, we gather the social network topology of Orkut, so that we could analyze user interaction data in light of the social graph. Our data analysis suggests insights into how users interact with friends in Orkut, such as how frequently users visit their friends' and non-immediate friends' pages. Results show that browsing, which cannot be inferred from crawling publicly available data, accounts for 92% of all user activities. Consequently, compared to using only crawled data, silent interactions like browsing friends' pages increase the measured level of interaction among users. Additionally, we find that friends requesting content are often within close geographical proximity of the uploader. We also discuss a series of implications of our findings for efficient system and interface design as well as for advertisement placement in online social networks.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1016/j.ins.2011.12.009","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"related_articles_were_imported":false,"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-08-02T13:11:25.836Z"},"cited_articles":[]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6107eefeb023a101bc07fb62"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"b9R/L6AjSkqbQKzvvP2NEg==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"Topological Features of Online Social Networks","authors":["Emilio Ferrara","G.

The content uploaded to OSNs (such as pictures, status updates, comments) is by default available to the OSN provider, and often to other people to whom the user who uploaded the content did not intend to give access. A different class of concerns relates to sensitive information that can be inferred from the behavior of users. For example, the analysis of user interactions augments social network graphs with potentially privacy-sensitive details on the nature of social relations, such as the strength of user relationships. A solution to prevent such inferences is to automatically generate dummy interactions that obfuscate the real interactions between OSN users. Given an adversary that observes the obfuscated interactions, the goal is to prevent the adversary from recovering parameters of interest (e.g., relationships strength) that accurately describe the real user interactions. The design and evaluation of obfuscation strategies requires metrics that express the level of protection they would offer when deployed in a particular OSN with its underlying user interaction patterns. In this paper we propose mutual information as obfuscation metric. It measures the amount of information leaked by the (observable) obfuscated interactions in the system on the (concealed) real interactions between users. We show that the metric is suitable for comparing different obfuscation strategies, and flexible to accommodate different network topologies and user communication patterns. Obfuscation comes at the cost of network overhead, and the proposed metric contributes to enabling the optimization of strategies to achieve good levels of privacy protection at minimum overhead. We provide a detailed methodology to compute the metric and perform experiments that illustrate its suitability.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1142/s0218488512400284","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"related_articles_were_imported":false,"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-08-02T13:11:27.376Z"},"cited_articles":[]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6107eeffb023a101bc07fb64"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"Waj76GBxRNiNLDKaM+6TRg==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"Preventing Private Information Inference Attacks on Social Networks","authors":["R.

Here we propose a way of mathematically formalizing this “equitability” criterion, using core concepts from information theory. This criterion is naturally satisfied by a fundamental information-theoretic measure of dependence called “mutual information.” By contrast, a recently introduced dependence measure called the “maximal information coefficient” is seen to violate equitability. We conclude that estimating mutual information provides a natural and practical method for equitably quantifying associations in large datasets. How should one quantify the strength of association between two random variables without bias for relationships of a specific form? Despite its conceptual simplicity, this notion of statistical “equitability” has yet to receive a definitive mathematical formalization. Here we argue that equitability is properly formalized by a self-consistency condition closely related to Data Processing Inequality. Mutual information, a fundamental quantity in information theory, is shown to satisfy this equitability criterion. These findings are at odds with the recent work of Reshef et al. [Reshef DN, et al. (2011) Science 334(6062):1518–1524], which proposed an alternative definition of equitability and introduced a new statistic, the “maximal information coefficient” (MIC), said to satisfy equitability in contradistinction to mutual information. These conclusions, however, were supported only with limited simulation evidence, not with mathematical arguments. Upon revisiting these claims, we prove that the mathematical definition of equitability proposed by Reshef et al. cannot be satisfied by any (nontrivial) dependence measure. We also identify artifacts in the reported simulation evidence. When these artifacts are removed, estimates of mutual information are found to be more equitable than estimates of MIC. Mutual information is also observed to have consistently higher statistical power than MIC. We conclude that estimating mutual information provides a natural (and often practical) way to equitably quantify statistical associations in large datasets.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1073/pnas.1309933111","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"related_articles_were_imported":false,"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-08-02T13:11:28.168Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"Va1Vm0T/QSmUHY06gzkRRA==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6107ef00b023a101bc07fb66"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"qwkyzty2TqyHjDAVB/kl4A==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"Link Prediction in Social Networks","authors":["V.

Typically, subgraph pattern matching is defined in terms of subgraph isomorphism, which is an NP-complete problem and sometimes too strict to find useful matches in certain applications. And how to protect the privacy of data graphs in subgraph pattern matching without undermining matching results is an important concern. Thus, we propose a novel framework to achieve the privacy-preserving subgraph pattern matching in cloud. In order to protect the structural privacy in data graphs, we firstly develop a k-automorphism model based method. Additionally, we use a cost-model based label generalization method to protect label privacy in both data graphs and pattern graphs. During the generation of the k-automorphic graph, a large number of noise edges or vertices might be introduced to the original data graph. Thus, we use the outsourced graph, which is only a subset of a k-automorphic graph, to answer the subgraph pattern matching. The efficiency of the pattern matching process can be greatly improved in this way. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the high efficiency of our framework.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1007/s11390-019-1969-x","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"related_articles_were_imported":false,"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-08-02T13:11:31.270Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"Va1Vm0T/QSmUHY06gzkRRA==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6107ef03b023a101bc07fb6a"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"Av4olA5BTL+B0jen6SMHMA==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"Security in Computing Systems - Challenges, Approaches and Solutions","authors":["J.

However, it is an NP-complete problem and too strict to find useful matches in certain applications. In addition, there exists another important concern, i.e., how to protect the privacy of data graphs in subgraph pattern matching without undermining matching results. To tackle these problems, we propose a novel framework to achieve the privacy-preserving subgraph pattern matching via strong simulation in cloud. Firstly, we develop a k-automorphism model based method to protect structural privacy in data graphs. Additionally, we use a cost-model based label generalization method to protect label privacy in both data graphs and pattern graphs. Owing to the symmetry in a k-automorphic graph, the subgraph pattern matching can be answered using the outsourced graph, which is only a subset of a k-automorphic graph. The efficiency of subgraph pattern matching can be greatly improved by this way. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the high efficiency and effectiveness of our framework.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1007/978-3-319-91452-7_20","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"related_articles_were_imported":false,"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-08-02T13:11:31.975Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"Va1Vm0T/QSmUHY06gzkRRA==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"+44FC39RT9ivvrbp+BWqGA==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6107ef04b023a101bc07fb6d"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"T6mHx/ZoSRGXxIccJ7E0wA==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"On the leakage of personally identifiable information via online social networks","authors":["B.

This article suggests a new approach to tackle these security and privacy problems with a special emphasis on the privacy of users with respect to the application provider in addition to defense against intruders or malicious users. In order to ensure users' privacy in the face of potential privacy violations by the provider, the suggested approach adopts a decentralized architecture relying on cooperation among a number of independent parties that are also the users of the online social network application. The second strong point of the suggested approach is to capitalize on the trust relationships that are part of social networks in real life in order to cope with the problem of building trusted and privacy- preserving mechanisms as part of the online application. The combination of these design principles is Safebook, a decentralized and privacy- preserving online social network application. Based on the two design principles, decentralization and exploiting real-life trust, various mechanisms for privacy and security are integrated into Safebook in order to provide data storage and data management functions that preserve users' privacy, data integrity, and availability. Preliminary evaluations of Safebook show that a realistic compromise between privacy and performance is feasible.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1109/MCOM.2009.5350374","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"related_articles_were_imported":false,"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-08-02T13:11:33.083Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"jS4wMjJWTb2Zu0i1bDLLOQ==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6107ef05b023a101bc07fb71"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"VhTadh6+Tiit96z/Koz36g==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"All your contacts are belong to us: automated identity theft attacks on social networks","authors":["Leyla Bilge","T.

Well-known sites such as Facebook have been reporting growth rates as high as 3% per week. Many social networking sites have millions of registered users who use these sites to share photographs, contact long-lost friends, establish new business contacts and to keep in touch. In this paper, we investigate how easy it would be for a potential attacker to launch automated crawling and identity theft attacks against a number of popular social networking sites in order to gain access to a large volume of personal user information. The first attack we present is the automated identity theft of existing user profiles and sending of friend requests to the contacts of the cloned victim. The hope, from the attacker's point of view, is that the contacted users simply trust and accept the friend request. By establishing a friendship relationship with the contacts of a victim, the attacker is able to access the sensitive personal information provided by them. In the second, more advanced attack we present, we show that it is effective and feasible to launch an automated, cross-site profile cloning attack. In this attack, we are able to automatically create a forged profile in a network where the victim is not registered yet and contact the victim's friends who are registered on both networks. Our experimental results with real users show that the automated attacks we present are effective and feasible in practice.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1145/1526709.1526784","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"related_articles_were_imported":false,"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-08-02T13:11:33.213Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"ggq4+ifZQxe2+pqUEKHk7Q==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"VvPRe9QeS/GeUg7DLVuPaA==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"AeShHh/xRey2MAbxeWd63Q==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"/thQTjAvT3O56Otqm5shEQ==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"JLXF3m32Q/+vakyfryC92w==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"Jqhodw0cSGCXBGgxQc9+hg==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"fcDz2EDHRIeEGCLwndlqdg==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"ttqOQkzXTu+Hbl1eg77xxA==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"Er0PD/N8S4yZx4DNPfO2jg==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"NA1NExzKSTG3MycxxTHXTg==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"Leue3fd+R3G+0fMVdSrw+A==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"Tta4/Iv5S2+nBxadVXSKTg==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"TgxEhRUESjCIbCFj+4UUmA==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"dhCsqXY2SYCq4w+AtZWUZg==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"VV4IbH9bSW++s7omJxdLNw==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"cKH6EOUBSx+GIRl7Ulza6A==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"j6sYtJ60SuCU2zcKig5zgw==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"MtYQXQSOQ/WBpvq6qkmIxA==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"vBG59RutQz2EvFZIs7j2XA==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"ELnBwZJoRjOk8D8yh9mczw==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"YgaeVhBsTqKwXb8McISExw==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"KY55Z43DTV2zD791lECN8Q==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"FT2UzP4wSwKSRnTjtCmf+g==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6107ef06b023a101bc07fb72"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"IKBtxhgtTpS91ZDHpZkOyQ==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"The Privacy Jungle: On the Market for Data Protection in Social Networks","authors":["Joseph Bonneau","Sören Preibusch"],"date":{"$date":"2009-08-02T00:00:00.000Z"},"pdf_url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4419-6967-5_8","abstract":"We have conducted the first thorough analysis of the market for privacy practices and policies in online social networks. From an evaluation of 45 social networking sites using 260 criteria we find that many popular assumptions regarding privacy and social networking need to be revisited when considering the entire ecosystem instead of only a handful of well-known sites. Contrary to the common perception of an oligopolistic market, we find evidence of vigorous competition for new users. Despite observing many poor security practices, there is evidence that social network providers are making efforts to implement privacy enhancing technologies with substantial diversity in the amount of privacy control offered. However, privacy is rarely used as a selling point, even then only as auxiliary, nondecisive feature. Sites also failed to promote their existing privacy controls within the site. We similarly found great diversity in the length and content of formal privacy policies, but found an opposite promotional trend: though almost all policies are not accessible to ordinary users due to obfuscating legal jargon, they conspicuously vaunt the sites’ privacy practices. We conclude that the market for privacy in social networks is dysfunctional in that there is significant variation in sites’ privacy controls, data collection requirements, and legal privacy policies, but this is not effectively conveyed to users. Our empirical findings motivate us to introduce the novel model of a privacy communication game, where the economically rational choice for a site operator is to make privacy control available to evade criticism from privacy fundamentalists, while hiding the privacy control interface and privacy policy to maximize sign-up numbers and encourage data sharing from the pragmatic majority of users.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1007/978-1-4419-6967-5_8","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"related_articles_were_imported":false,"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-08-02T13:11:34.542Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"BHuKbEDqRWmUF9teC+pL+w==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"fcDz2EDHRIeEGCLwndlqdg==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"ttqOQkzXTu+Hbl1eg77xxA==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"NA1NExzKSTG3MycxxTHXTg==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6107ef06b023a101bc07fb73"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"rppGbfrTTk+ZkvRuLES5ew==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"Persona: an online social network with user-defined privacy","authors":["Randolph Baden","Adam Bender","N.

In this paper, we introduce a novel de-anonymization attack that exploits group membership information that is available on social networking sites. More precisely, we show that information about the group memberships of a user (i.e., the groups of a social network to which a user belongs) is sufficient to uniquely identify this person, or, at least, to significantly reduce the set of possible candidates. That is, rather than tracking a user's browser as with cookies, it is possible to track a person. To determine the group membership of a user, we leverage well-known web browser history stealing attacks. Thus, whenever a social network user visits a malicious website, this website can launch our de-anonymization attack and learn the identity of its visitors. The implications of our attack are manifold, since it requires a low effort and has the potential to affect millions of social networking users. We perform both a theoretical analysis and empirical measurements to demonstrate the feasibility of our attack against Xing, a medium-sized social network with more than eight million members that is mainly used for business relationships.

These peer-to-peer (P2P) online social networks do not rely on centralized storage of user data. Instead, data can be stored not only on a computer of a profile owner but almost anywhere (friends' computers, random peers from the social network, third-party external storage, etc.). Since the external storage is often untrusted or only semi-trusted, encryption plays a fundamental role in security of P2P social networks. Encryption, however, also adds some overhead in both the time and space domains. To be scalable, a system that relies heavily on encryption should use as efficient algorithms as possible. It also needs to provide the functionality of changing access rights at reasonable cost, and, crucially, the system should preserve privacy properties itself. That is, beyond user data confidentiality, it has to protect against information leakage about users' access rights and traffic analysis. In this paper we explore the requirements of encryption for P2P social networks in detail and propose a list of criteria for evaluation. We then compare a set of approaches from the literature according to these criteria. We find that none of the current P2P architectures for social networks manages to achieve secure, efficient, 24/7 access control enforcement and data storage. They either rely on trust, require constantly running servers for each user, use expensive encryption, or fail to protect privacy of access information. In the search for a solution that better fulfills the criteria, we found that some broadcast encryption (BE) schemes exhibit several desirable properties. We thus propose to use BE schemes with high performance encryption/decryption regardless of the number of identities/groups for an efficient encryption-based access control in the P2P environment. We define relevant properties for the BE schemes to be used in the P2P social network scenario and describe advantages that such schemes have compared to encryption techniques used in existing P2P architectures.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1109/PASSAT/SocialCom.2011.158","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"related_articles_were_imported":false,"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-08-02T13:11:36.888Z"},"cited_articles":[]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6107ef09b023a101bc07fb7a"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"W++IgNxBSMKsLfSS5OKryA==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"Supervised random walks: predicting and recommending links in social networks","authors":["L.

We achieve this by using these attributes to guide a random walk on the graph. We formulate a supervised learning task where the goal is to learn a function that assigns strengths to edges in the network such that a random walker is more likely to visit the nodes to which new links will be created in the future.

In this paper, we describe our efforts to detect, characterize and understand Sybil account activity in the Renren online social network (OSN). We use ground truth provided by Renren Inc. to build measurement based Sybil account detectors, and deploy them on Renren to detect over 100,000 Sybil accounts. We study these Sybil accounts, as well as an additional 560,000 Sybil accounts caught by Renren, and analyze their link creation behavior. Most interestingly, we find that contrary to prior conjecture, Sybil accounts in OSNs do not form tight-knit communities. Instead, they integrate into the social graph just like normal users. Using link creation timestamps, we verify that the large majority of links between Sybil accounts are created accidentally, unbeknownst to the attacker. Overall, only a very small portion of Sybil accounts are connected to other Sybils with social links. Our study shows that existing Sybil defenses are unlikely to succeed in today's OSNs, and we must design new techniques to effectively detect and defend against Sybil attacks.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1145/2068816.2068841","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"related_articles_were_imported":false,"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-08-02T13:11:39.652Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"NA1NExzKSTG3MycxxTHXTg==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6107ef0cb023a101bc07fb7d"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"TgxEhRUESjCIbCFj+4UUmA==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"Security Issues in Online Social Networks","authors":["Hongyu Gao","Jun Hu","Tuo Huang","Jingnan Wang","Y.

As a result, new interdisciplinary research directions have emerged in which social network analysis methods are applied to networks containing hundreds millions of users. Unfortunately, links between individuals may be missing due to imperfect acquirement processes or because they are not yet reflected in the online network (i.e., friends in real world did not form a virtual connection.) Existing link prediction techniques lack the scalability required for full application on a continuously growing social network which may be adding everyday users with thousands of connections. The primary bottleneck in link prediction techniques is extracting structural features required for classifying links. In this paper we propose a set of simple, easy-to-compute structural features that can be analyzed to identify missing links. We show that a machine learning classifier trained using the proposed simple structural features can successfully identify missing links even when applied to a hard problem of classifying links between individuals who have at least one common friend. A new friends measure that we developed is shown to be a good predictor for missing links and an evaluation experiment was performed on five large social networks datasets: Face book, Flickr, You Tube, Academia and The Marker. Our methods can provide social network site operators with the capability of helping users to find known, offline contacts and to discover new friends online. They may also be used for exposing hidden links in an online social network.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1109/PASSAT/SocialCom.2011.20","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"related_articles_were_imported":false,"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-08-02T13:11:50.778Z"},"cited_articles":[]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6107ef17b023a101bc07fb81"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"dhCsqXY2SYCq4w+AtZWUZg==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"Reverse Social Engineering Attacks in Online Social Networks","authors":["D.

Facebook, for example, has been ranked as the second most visited site on the Internet, and has been reporting growth rates as high as 3% per week. One of the key features of social networks is the support they provide for finding new friends. For example, social network sites may try to automatically identify which users know each other in order to propose friendship recommendations. \n \nClearly, most social network sites are critical with respect to user's security and privacy due to the large amount of information available on them, as well as their very large user base. Previous research has shown that users of online social networks tend to exhibit a higher degree of trust in friend requests and messages sent by other users. Even though the problem of unsolicited messages in social networks (i.e., spam) has already been studied in detail, to date, reverse social engineering attacks in social networks have not received any attention. In a reverse social engineering attack, the attacker does not initiate contact with the victim. Rather, the victim is tricked into contacting the attacker herself. As a result, a high degree of trust is established between the victim and the attacker as the victim is the entity that established the relationship. \n \nIn this paper, we present the first user study on reverse social engineering attacks in social networks. That is, we discuss and show how attackers, in practice, can abuse some of the friend-finding features that online social networks provide with the aim of launching reverse social engineering attacks. Our results demonstrate that reverse social engineering attacks are feasible and effective in practice.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1007/978-3-642-22424-9_4","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"related_articles_were_imported":false,"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-08-02T13:11:51.630Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"ttqOQkzXTu+Hbl1eg77xxA==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"NA1NExzKSTG3MycxxTHXTg==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"vBG59RutQz2EvFZIs7j2XA==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"iKKxFjoQQL6wHO6c7ysbag==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"YgaeVhBsTqKwXb8McISExw==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6107ef17b023a101bc07fb82"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"KXz3kwYfQ3+jYXwqD6s4NQ==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"Characterizing user navigation and interactions in online social networks","authors":["Fabrício Benevenuto","Tiago Rodrigues","M.

The data were collected from a social network aggregator website in Brazil, which enables users to connect to multiple social networks with a single authentication. Our analysis of the clickstream data reveals key features of the social network workloads, such as how frequently people connect to social networks and for how long, as well as the types and sequences of activities that users conduct on these sites. Additionally, we gather the social network topology of Orkut, so that we could analyze user interaction data in light of the social graph. Our data analysis suggests insights into how users interact with friends in Orkut, such as how frequently users visit their friends' and non-immediate friends' pages. Results show that browsing, which cannot be inferred from crawling publicly available data, accounts for 92% of all user activities. Consequently, compared to using only crawled data, silent interactions like browsing friends' pages increase the measured level of interaction among users. Additionally, we find that friends requesting content are often within close geographical proximity of the uploader. We also discuss a series of implications of our findings for efficient system and interface design as well as for advertisement placement in online social networks.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1016/j.ins.2011.12.009","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"related_articles_were_imported":false,"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-08-02T13:11:51.789Z"},"cited_articles":[]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6107ef17b023a101bc07fb83"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"fs0WgB0PQdmcxI2hsW/ZOQ==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"DECENT: A decentralized architecture for enforcing privacy in online social networks","authors":["Sonia Jahid","Shirin Nilizadeh","Prateek Mittal","N.

To address this problem, we propose a topic oriented community detection approach which combines both social objects clustering and link analysis. We first use a subspace clustering algorithm to group all the social objects into topics. Then we divide the members that are involved in those social objects into topical clusters, each corresponding to a distinct topic. In order to differentiate the strength of connections, we perform a link analysis on each topical cluster to detect the topical communities.

Huge amount of information is being shared through popular OSN sites. This aspect of sharing information to a large number of individuals with ease has attracted social spammers to exploit the network of trust for spreading spam messages to promote personal blogs, advertisements, phishing, scam and so on. In this paper, we present a Markov Clustering (MCL) based approach for the detection of spam profiles on OSNs. Our study is based on a real dataset of Facebook profiles, which includes both benign and spam profiles. We model social network using a weighted graph in which profiles are represented as nodes and their interactions as edges. The weight of an edge, connecting a pair of user profiles, is calculated as a function of their real social interactions in terms of active friends, page likes and shared URLs within the network. MCL is applied on the weighted graph to generate different clusters containing different categories of profiles. Majority voting is applied to handle the cases in which a cluster contains both spam and normal profiles. Our experimental results show that majority voting not only reduces the number of clusters to a minimum, but also increases the performance values in terms of FP and FB measures from FP=0.85 and FB=0.75 to FP=0.88 and FB=0.79, respectively.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1109/TrustCom.2012.83","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"related_articles_were_imported":false,"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-08-02T13:11:55.049Z"},"cited_articles":[]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6107ef1bb023a101bc07fb87"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"i9+W6fi+S/69qbsgvwtnBw==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"CopyCatch: stopping group attacks by spotting lockstep behavior in social networks","authors":["Alex Beutel","Wanhong Xu","V.

This paper presents SybilDefender, a sybil defense mechanism that leverages the network topologies to defend against sybil attacks in social networks. Based on performing a limited number of random walks within the social graphs, SybilDefender is efficient and scalable to large social networks. Our experiments on two 3,000,000 node real-world social topologies show that SybilDefender outperforms the state of the art by more than 10 times in both accuracy and running time. SybilDefender can effectively identify the sybil nodes and detect the sybil community around a sybil node, even when the number of sybil nodes introduced by each attack edge is close to the theoretically detectable lower bound. Besides, we propose two approaches to limiting the number of attack edges in online social networks. The survey results of our Facebook application show that the assumption made by previous work that all the relationships in social networks are trusted does not apply to online social networks, and it is feasible to limit the number of attack edges in online social networks by relationship rating.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1109/TPDS.2013.9","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"related_articles_were_imported":false,"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-08-02T13:11:56.886Z"},"cited_articles":[]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6107ef1db023a101bc07fb8c"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"MtYQXQSOQ/WBpvq6qkmIxA==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"Peri-Watchdog: Hunting for hidden botnets in the periphery of online social networks","authors":["Guanhua Yan"],"date":{"$date":"2013-08-02T00:00:00.000Z"},"pdf_url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.comnet.2012.07.016","abstract":"In order to evade detection of ever-improving defense techniques, modern botnet masters are constantly looking for new communication platforms for delivering C&C (Command and Control) information. Attracting their attention is the emergence of online social networks such as Twitter, as the information dissemination mechanism provided by these networks can naturally be exploited for spreading botnet C&C information, and the enormous amount of normal communications co-existing in these networks makes it a daunting task to tease out botnet C&C messages. Against this backdrop, we explore graph-theoretic techniques that aid effective monitoring of potential botnet activities in large open online social networks. Our work is based on extensive analysis of a Twitter dataset that contains more than 40million users and 1.4billion following relationships, and mine patterns from the Twitter network structure that can be leveraged for improving efficiency of botnet monitoring. Our analysis reveals that the static Twitter topology contains a small-sized core sugraph, after removing which, the Twitter network breaks down into small connected components, each of which can be handily monitored for potential botnet activities. Based on this observation, we propose a method called Peri-Watchdog, which computes the core of a large online social network and derives the set of nodes that are likely to pass botnet C&C information in the periphery of online social network. We analyze the time complexity of Peri-Watchdog under its normal operations. We further apply Peri-Watchdog on the Twitter graph injected with synthetic botnet structures and investigate the effectiveness of Peri-Watchdog in detecting potential C&C information from these botnets. To verify whether patterns observed from the static Twitter graph are common to other online social networks, we analyze another online social network dataset, BrightKite, which contains evolution of social graphs formed by its users in half a year. We show not only that there exists a similarly relatively small core in the BrightKite network, but also this core remains stable over the course of BrightKite evolution. We also find that to accommodate the dynamic growth of BrightKite, the core has to be updated about every 18days under a constrained monitoring capacity.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1016/j.comnet.2012.07.016","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"related_articles_were_imported":false,"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-08-02T13:11:57.047Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"s4XKTpfQSxyqrF3CAl4w4A==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6107ef1db023a101bc07fb8d"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"xKpwZSKDQ4aWv1xVjqdmmQ==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"Security issues in cloud environments: a survey","authors":["Diogo A.

Unfortunately, in the wrong hands, OSNs can be used to harvest private user data, distribute malware, control botnets, perform surveillance, spread misinformation, and even influence algorithmic trading. Usually, an adversary starts off by running an infiltration campaign using hijacked or adversary-owned OSN accounts, with an objective to connect with a large number of users in the targeted OSN. In this article, we evaluate how vulnerable OSNs are to a large-scale infiltration campaign run by socialbots: bots that control OSN accounts and mimic the actions of real users. We adopted the design of a traditional web-based botnet and built a prototype of a Socialbot Network (SbN): a group of coordinated programmable socialbots. We operated our prototype on Facebook for 8weeks, and collected data about user behavior in response to a large-scale infiltration campaign. Our results show that (1) by exploiting known social behaviors of users, OSNs such as Facebook can be infiltrated with a success rate of up to 80%, (2) subject to user profile privacy settings, a successful infiltration can result in privacy breaches where even more private user data are exposed, (3) given the economics of today's underground markets, running a large-scale infiltration campaign might be profitable but is still not particularly attractive as a sustainable and independent business, (4) the security of socially-aware systems that use or integrate OSN platforms can be at risk, given the infiltration capability of an adversary in OSNs, and (5) defending against malicious socialbots raises a set of challenges that relate to web automation, online-offline identity binding, and usable security.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1016/j.comnet.2012.06.006","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"related_articles_were_imported":false,"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-08-02T13:11:57.573Z"},"cited_articles":[]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6107ef1db023a101bc07fb8f"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"ELnBwZJoRjOk8D8yh9mczw==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"Mutual-friend based attacks in social network systems","authors":["Lei Jin","J.

Usually, SNSs, such as LinkedIn and Google Plus, also include a feature that allows a user to query mutual friends between him and any other user he can reach using the available public search feature in SNSs. While such a mutual friend feature is very helpful in letting users find new friends and connect to them, in this paper, we show that it also raises significant privacy concerns as an adversary can use it to find out some or all of the victim's friends, although, as per the privacy settings of the victim, the adversary is not authorized to see his friend list directly. We show that by using mutual friend queries, an attacker can launch privacy attacks that we refer to as mutual-friend based attacks to identify friends and distant neighbors of targeted users. We analyze these attacks and identify various attack structures that an attacker can use to build attack strategies, using which an attacker can identify a user's friends and his distant neighbors. Through simulations, we demonstrate that mutual-friend based attacks are effective. For instance, one of the simulation results show that an attacker using just one attacker node can identify more than 60% of a user's friends.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1016/j.cose.2013.04.003","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"related_articles_were_imported":false,"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-08-02T13:11:57.817Z"},"cited_articles":[]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6107ef1fb023a101bc07fb90"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"eJy0/3GRRriSVvWZdlzYEA==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"Preventing Private Information Inference Attacks on Social Networks","authors":["R.

Even though the effectiveness of security measures to protect sensitive information is increasing, people remain susceptible to manipulation and thus the human element remains a weak link. A social engineering attack targets this weakness by using various manipulation techniques to elicit sensitive information. The field of social engineering is still in its early stages with regard to formal definitions, attack frameworks and templates of attacks. This paper proposes detailed social engineering attack templates that are derived from real-world social engineering examples. Current documented examples of social engineering attacks do not include all the attack steps and phases. The proposed social engineering attack templates attempt to alleviate the problem of limited documented literature on social engineering attacks by mapping the real-world examples to the social engineering attack framework. Mapping several similar real-world examples to the social engineering attack framework allows one to establish a detailed flow of the attack whilst abstracting subjects and objects. This mapping is then utilised to propose the generalised social engineering attack templates that are representative of real-world examples, whilst still being general enough to encompass several different real-world examples. The proposed social engineering attack templates cover all three types of communication, namely bidirectional communication, unidirectional communication and indirect communication. In order to perform comparative studies of different social engineering models, processes and frameworks, it is necessary to have a formalised set of social engineering attack scenarios that are fully detailed in every phase and step of the process. The social engineering attack templates are converted to social engineering attack scenarios by populating the template with both subjects and objects from real-world examples whilst still maintaining the detailed flow of the attack as provided in the template. Furthermore, this paper illustrates how the social engineering attack scenarios are applied to verify a social engineering attack detection model. These templates and scenarios can be used by other researchers to either expand on, use for comparative measures, create additional examples or evaluate models for completeness. Additionally, the proposed social engineering attack templates can also be used to develop social engineering awareness material.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1016/j.cose.2016.03.004","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"related_articles_were_imported":false,"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-08-02T13:11:59.973Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"hz8kZYAkR06BwsrXU2fQkA==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6107ef20b023a101bc07fb93"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"YgaeVhBsTqKwXb8McISExw==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"Advanced social engineering attacks","authors":["Katharina Krombholz","Heidelinde Hobel","Markus Huber","E.

However, they are also full of spammers who frequently conduct social spamming on them. Massive social spammers and spam messages heavily hurt the user experience and hinder the healthy development of microblogging systems. Thus, effectively detecting the social spammers and spam messages is of great value to both microblogging users and websites. Existing studies usually treat social spammer detection and spam message detection as two separate tasks. However, social spammers and spam messages have strong inherent connections, since social spammers tend to post more spam messages and spam messages have high probabilities to be posted by social spammers. Thus combining social spammer detection with spam message detection has the potential to boost the performance of both tasks. In this paper, we propose a unified approach for social spammer and spam message co-detection in microblogging. Our approach utilizes the posting relations between users and messages to combine social spammer detection with spam message detection. In addition, we extract the social relations between users and the connections between messages to refine detection results.

Twitter is one of such popular social networks having more than 152 million daily active users making a half billions of tweets per day. Owing to its immense popularity, the accounts of legitimate Twitter users are always at a risk from spammers and hackers. Spam and Malware are the most affecting threats reported on the Twitter platform. To preserve the privacy and ensure data safety for online Twitter community, it is necessary develop a framework to safeguard their accounts from such malicious attackers. Machine Learning is recently matured and widely used technique useful to prevent the propagation of such malicious activities in social media. However, the Machine Learning based techniques have yielded a promising result in filtering the undesired contents from the user tweets but its efficiency always remains restricted within the technological limits of the technique used. To devise a more efficient model to detect propagation of spam and malware in the Twitter, this research has proposed a Machine Learning based optimization scheme based on hybrid similarity (Cosine and Jaccard) measured in conjunction with Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The Cosine with Jaccard in hybridization has been applied on the Twitter dataset to identify the tweets containing spam and malware. In conjunction to it the GA has been used to enhance the training rate and reduce training error by automatically selecting the designed fitness function while the ANN was applied to classify malicious tweets from through voting rule. The simulation experiments were conducted to compute the precision rate, recall, F-measures. The results of Machine Learning based optimization scheme proposed in this research were compared with the existing stateof-arts techniques already available in this regime. The comparative study reveals that the model proposed in this research is faster and more precise then the existing models.

This article addresses the nature and the characteristics of spam profiles in a social network like Twitter to improve spam detection, based on a number of publicly available language-independent features. In order to investigate the effectiveness of these features in spam detection, four datasets are extracted for four different language contexts (i.e. Arabic, English, Korean and Spanish), and a fifth is formed by combining them all. We conduct our experiments using a set of five well-known classification algorithms in spam detection field, k-Nearest Neighbours (k-NN), Random Forest (RF), Naive Bayes (NB), Decision Tree (DT) (J48) and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) classifiers, along with five filter-based feature selection methods, namely, Information Gain, Chi-square, ReliefF, Correlation and Significance. The results show oscillating performance of each classifier across all datasets, but improved classification results with feature selection. In addition, detailed analysis and comparisons are carried out on two different levels: in the first level, we compare the selected features’ importance among the feature selection methods, whereas in the second level, we observe the relations and the importance of the selected features across all datasets.

This model can help in understanding the evolution of interactions and relationships between network members. Many applications use link prediction such as recommendation systems. Most of the existing link prediction algorithms are based on similarity measures, such as common neighbors and the Adamic/Adar index. The main disadvantage of these algorithms is the low accuracy of results since they depend on the application domain. Moreover, the datasets of link prediction have two significant problems: the imbalanced class distribution and the large size of the data. In this chapter, evolutionary neural network-based models are developed to solve this problem. Three optimizers are used for training feedforward neural network models including genetic algorithm, particle swarm optimization, and moth search. For this purpose, the link prediction problem is formulated as a classification problem to improve the accuracy of the results by constructing features of the traditional link prediction methods and centrality measures in any given link prediction dataset. Also, this work tries to address two problems of the data in two ways: externally using sampling techniques (random and undersampling) and internally using the geometric mean as a fitness function in the proposed algorithms. The results reveal that the proposed model is superior in terms of the sensitivity and geometric mean measures compared to the traditional classifiers and traditional link prediction algorithms.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1007/978-981-32-9990-0_6","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"related_articles_were_imported":false,"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-08-02T13:12:11.932Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"NA1NExzKSTG3MycxxTHXTg==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6107ef2eb023a101bc07fb9d"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"R18jMKx6S/+z0oZLwZXP3w==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"A Virtual & Pragmatic Analysis on Networked Security Incident, its Handling & Reporting Measures","authors":["Gyana Ranjana Panigrahi","Dr Nalin Kanta Barpanda","M.

One of these social platforms that have attracted more attention in past years is Instagram. Instagram has widely used for sharing photos and videos and is profitable for celebrities, businesses, and people with a considerable number of followers. In the meantime, this high profit made this platform prone to be the potential place to be used for malicious activities. One of the essential malicious activities in the Instagram platform is fake accounts. However, in this paper, an efficient method for identifying Instagram fake accounts is proposed. In the presented model. First, a dataset of legitimate and fake accounts is created. Then, the collected dataset has been used as input of the bagging classifier to classify fake users on the dataset. Furthermore, the proposed method compared to the five well-known machine-learning classifiers in terms of classification accuracy to better evaluate effectiveness of the method.

Malicious attackers use compromised OSN accounts to spread fake news, to send spam messages and to promote malicious applications which in turn lead to substantial financial and reputation loss. The current scenario in the world is that heavily funded and sophisticated criminal groups execute these malicious activities. Numerous Twitter accounts are either fake or compromised as they are victims of these attacks. Detecting these compromised accounts is a challenging task due to various reasons, including the dynamic behaviour of OSN services and its users. A new framework titled User Behaviour Analytics based Compromised Account Detection(UbCadet) proposed in this paper. Some of the significant derived attributes proposed in this work to profile a Twitter user are Similarity of tweet text, Similarity of hashtag, time of tweeting and Geo-location information. In this work, User Behavioural Profile builds with derived attributes of a Twitter user. Based on this user profile, the tweets of each user converts to individual tweet patterns. These patterns are classified as normal or anomalous using k-Nearest Neighbour machine learning algorithm. Additionally, the ensemble method and Random Forest classifier has also experimented for pattern classification. An account classifies as compromised or benign based on the frequency of normal or anomalous tweets from that account. The dataset collected from Yelp, which is a popular crowd-sourced review forum is also used for the experiment in addition to the Twitter dataset, to examine the applicability of the proposed approach in other OSNs. Experimental results show that the proposed UbCadet achieves a high accuracy and reduced false-positive rate.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1007/s11042-020-08721-z","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"related_articles_were_imported":false,"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-08-02T13:12:15.978Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"NA1NExzKSTG3MycxxTHXTg==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6107ef30b023a101bc07fba0"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"faooaskNQ3ax+LDPmjEayw==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"Sentiment Analysis for e-Payment Service Providers Using Evolutionary eXtreme Gradient Boosting","authors":["Dana A.

Scrambling of audio files breaks the correlation between adjacent samples in order to convert the original audio to an unintelligible format. Scrambling is used to protect the audio against wiretapping and illegal surveillance, in addition to being a step in security algorithms, such as watermarking and encryption algorithms. Cellular automata are models that are discrete in nature and depend on simple and local rules to achieve an interesting overall behavior. Two-dimensional cellular automata were previously proposed as a key generation mechanism to scramble audio files. The mechanism was built upon be researchers in the multimedia security field. This paper explores the use of one-dimensional cellular automata in audio scrambling, which simplifies the process as deploying two-dimensional cellular automata requires changing the dimension of the audio file and the one-dimensional cellular automata does not, additionally, elementary one-dimensional cellular automata requires less parameters to configure. The scrambling degree is used to evaluate the model effectiveness in breaking the correlation of adjacent samples. In the experiments, different parameters are taken into account including the cellular automata class, the iterations needed and the method used to calculate the cells at the boundary. Experiments show that the one-dimensional cellular automata are capable of scrambling the audio file without any dimensional change and the chaotic rules tested give the highest scrambling degree.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.5539/MAS.V13N1P136","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"related_articles_were_imported":false,"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-08-02T13:12:18.870Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"NA1NExzKSTG3MycxxTHXTg==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6107ef33b023a101bc07fba5"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"bemNvgFcQEq0Emyd5Snv9Q==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"Secure software engineering: Evaluation of emerging trends","authors":["A.

Many security approaches have appeared to solve security problems by applying a set of activities through Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). Among the top approaches are McGraw's Touchpoints, Comprehensive Lightweight Application Security Process (CLASP) from Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) organization, and Microsoft Security Development Lifecycle (SDL). In this paper, we evaluate these three security approaches by discussing their common process, strength, and limitations. Moreover, we discuss why these approaches do not effectively increase software security.

Recently, such criminals were able to steal a number of accounts that belong to NatWest bank's customers. Their attack vector was based on spam tweets posted by a Twitter account which looked very close to NatWest customer support account and leaded users to a link of a phishing site. In this study, we investigate the nature of spam profiles in Twitter with a goal to improve social spam detection. Based on a set of publicly available features, we develop spam profiles detection models. At this stage, a dataset of 82 Twitter's profiles are collected and analyzed. With feature engineering, we investigate ten binary and simple features that can be used to classify spam profiles. Moreover, a feature selection process is utilized to identify the most influencing features in the process of detecting spam profiles. For feature selection, two methods are used ReliefF and Information Gain. While for classification, four classification algorithms are applied and compared: Decision Trees, Multilayer Perceptron, k-Nearest neighbors and Naive Bayes. Preliminary experiments in this work show that the promising detection rates can be obtained using such features regardless of the language of the tweets.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1109/IACS.2017.7921959","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"related_articles_were_imported":false,"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-08-02T13:12:19.835Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"NA1NExzKSTG3MycxxTHXTg==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6107ef33b023a101bc07fba7"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"9xR3EfnkSm+yDGSVBfYuvA==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"Behaviour Profiling of Reactions in Facebook Posts for Anomaly Detection","authors":["P.V.

Malicious activities are massive nowadays in this network and spreading fake news, sending spam messages, fake applications and like jacking are a few among them, which leads to huge financial and reputation loss. The current scenario in the world is that the malicious activities are executed by heavily funded criminal groups. A larger part of Facebook accounts are either fake or compromised and they take part in malicious activities. Finding these malicious accounts is a challenging task. Social influence based behavioural analysis is one of the approaches towards detecting malicious activities. Facebook users are influenced by other user's posts/reactions. On observing the change in reactions, anomalous behaviour of the corresponding accounts can be identified. This paper proposes a method based on unsupervised clustering which analyse the reactions of users called smileys. The reactions are profiled and by applying similarity measures and unsupervised clustering techniques, they are further classified. This approach reveals the behaviour of immediate emotional responses of users to the various posts in Facebook. Since reactions are immediate, the analysis of these reactions provides important information to find anomalous behaviour in Facebook accounts","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1109/ICOAC.2017.8441402","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"related_articles_were_imported":false,"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-08-02T13:12:19.973Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"NA1NExzKSTG3MycxxTHXTg==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6107ef34b023a101bc07fba8"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"FJ+O8sE/Q5+saw39L+Vpig==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"Improving email spam detection using content based feature engineering approach","authors":["Wadi' Hijawi","Hossam Faris","Ja'far Alqatawna","Ala’ M.

One knows [21 that the existence of a contact form on Mm allows a reduction of the structure group of the tangent bundle of M to U(n) and hence, in particular, the odd-dimensional Stiefel-Whitney classes of M have to vanish [4]. This, however, gives no information in dimension 3 and in [31 Chern 1 asked: Does every closed, smooth, orientable 3-manifold admit a smooth contact form? This question was first answered (in the affirmative) by Lutz [6] and Martinet [7]. They based their proof on the theorem that every closed, orientable 3-manifold can be obtained from S3 by surgery, the same theorem used by Lickorish, Novikov and Zieschang to prove that every such manifold admits a codimension 1 foliation, i.e. a nonzero 1-form 1/ on M such that 71 A d71 0; that is, in dimension 3, the exact opposite of a contact form.

M also has an almost complex structure associated with a, up-to homotopy. It has been asked whether every closed symplectic manifold has also a Kaehler structure (the converse is immediate). A Kaehler manifold has the property that its odd dimensional Betti numbers are even. H. Guggenheimer claimed [1], [2] that a symplectic manifold also has even odd Betti numbers.

One type of growth considered there is called polynomial growth and it has been conjectured that a finitely generated group has polynomial growth if, and only if, it has a nilpotent subgroup of finite index. That groups which have a nilpotent subgroup of finite index have polynomial growth has been shown by Wolf [22] (see also Bass [1]). So far, the converse has been proved for solvable groups (Milnor-Wolf [9, 22]) and for linear groups (Tits [21]). In the present note we show that the conjecture is true for finitely generated groups of ditterentiable germs. There are also related results about groups of homeomorphisms which may be of independent interest. Our interest in groups of germs was motivated by the study of holonomy groups of foliations and we give some applications in that direction. It turns out, for example, that holonomy groups of codimension one, transversely oriented foliations of class C 2 which have polynomial growth, must actually be abelian.

U C,) is a 2g-punctured sphere. We call an isotopy class of such collections a cut system. Of course, any two cut systems are related by a diffeomorphism of M, by the classification of surfaces. We show that any two cut systems are also joined by a finite sequence of simple moues, in which just one Cj changes at a time, to a circle intersecting it transversely in one point and disjoint from the other Ci’s. Furthermore, we find a short list of relations between sequences of simple moves, sufficient to pass between any two sequences of simple moves joining the same pair of cut systems. From these properties of cut systems it is a routine matter to read off a finite presentation for the mapping class group of M, the group of isotopy classes of orientation preserving self-diffeomorphisms of M. Unfortunately, the presentation so obtained is rather complicated, and stands in need of considerable simplification before much light will be shed on the structure of the mapping class group. Qualitatively, one can at least deduce from the presentation that all relations follow from relations supported in certain subsurfaces of M, finite in number, of genus at most two. This may be compared with the result of Dehn [3] and Lickorish [4] that the mapping class group is generated by diffeomorphisms supported in finitely many annuli. A finite presentation in genus two was obtained by Birman-Hilden[2], completing a program begun by Bergau-Mennicke [l]. For higher genus the existence of finite presentations was shown by McCool[ lo], using more algebraic techniques. For another approach to finite presentations, see [12], and for general background on mapping class groups, see [ 111. Our methods apply also to maximal systems of disjoint, non-contractible, nonisotopic circles on M. This is discussed briefly in an appendix.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1016/0040-9383(80)90009-9","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"related_articles_were_imported":false,"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-08-02T13:12:51.983Z"},"cited_articles":[]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6107ef56b023a101bc07fbd2"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"pHU9meuyQ1+GbDkiuvASNQ==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"On the Nielsen type and the classification for the mapping class group","authors":["Jane Gilman"],"date":{"$date":"1981-08-02T00:00:00.000Z"},"pdf_url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/0001-8708%2881%2990033-5","abstract":"Let S be a compact surface of genus g with n boundary components, with 2g - 2 + n > 0, and let M(S) be its mapping class group (also known as the Teichmiiller modular group).

A major thrust of mathematics in the late 19th century, in which Poincare had a large role, was the uniformization theory for Riemann surfaces: that every conformai structure on a closed oriented surface is represented by a Riemannian metric of constant curvature. For the typical case of negative Euler characteristic (genus greater than 1) such a metric gives a hyperbolic structure: any small neighborhood in the surface is isometric to a neighborhood in the hyperbolic plane, and the surface itself is the quotient of the hyperbolic plane by a discrete group of motions. The exceptional cases, the sphere and the torus, have spherical and Euclidean structures. Three-manifolds are greatly more complicated than surfaces, and I think it is fair to say that until recently there was little reason to expect any analogous theory for manifolds of dimension 3 (or more)—except perhaps for the fact that so many 3-manifolds are beautiful.

A hyperbolic structure can be understood in terms of its deformations. Unfortunately, the variation of the hyperbolic metric, arising from a deformation, is not determined by local data. If z is a conformal coordinate for S and A, II H II 00 < 1, a Beltrami differential then dw = dz + p dJ defines a new conformal coordinate and structure SI. The tensor p may vanish on the open set 0 C S and yet the hyperbolic metrics of S and SI do not coincide on (. This phenomenon presents a s~erious difficulty in the deformation theory of hyperbolic structures. The Fenchel-Nielsen (twist) deformation does not share this defect. The deformation is defined by cutting the surface along a simple closed geodesic, rotating one side of the cut relative to the other, and attaching the sides in their new position. A geodesic intersecting the cut is deformed to a broken geodesic. The hyperbolic structure in the complement of the cut extends naturally to a hyperbolic structure on the new surface. The deformation is concentrated at the cut. The basic idea for the deformation appears in the work of Fricke-Klein, Dehn, and Fenchel-Nielsen [71, [8]. In the Fenchel-Nielsen manuscript the deformation was considered extensively; coordinates for Teichmiller space are defined in terms of the deformation. The proper definition is given by a Fuchsian group construction. Calculations are made in terms of unimodular matrices. This approach is often cumbersome. Our basic objective is to give a description of the deformation in terms of quasiconformal mappings. The Bers embedding of Teichmiiller space is central to the analytic theory of deformations. Using our characterization we calculate the first variation of the Bers embedding for the Fenchel-Nielsen deformation. The result is a Poincare series 6*, which already appears in the work of Petersson [16].","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.2307/2007011","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"related_articles_were_imported":false,"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-08-02T13:13:01.515Z"},"cited_articles":[]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6107ef5db023a101bc07fbda"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"aTWYMDpYSNuFjT26MeCdrQ==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"HOMOTOPY EQUIVALENCES OF 3‐MANIFOLDS WITH BOUNDARIES (Lecture Notes in Mathematics, 761)","authors":["G.

Because the eight cor­ I}ers can fit together at a point without distortion, the locally homogeneous ge­ ometry of the three-torus is Euclidean. Lest the reader be misled, we must point out that the preceding examples are not really typical because they are highly symmetrical. When a three-manifold is defined by gluing the faces of an irregu­ lar polyhedron, more care must be tak­ en to give the polyhedron a shape that leads to a locally homogeneous geome­ try for the three-manifold. The shapes of the polyhedral faces that are glued together must match, and the angles between the faces that surround any edge must add up to 360 degrees. There are at least two major differ­ ences between the geometry of two­ manifolds and the geometry of three­ manifolds. First, there are five more kinds of locally homogeneous geometry that can be given to three-manifolds, in addition to the three we have men­ tioned. The additional geometries come about because in three or more dimen­ sions an intrinsic curvature is defined for each two-dimensional slice that passes through a point. A locally homogeneous geometry need not have the same curva­ ture in all the two-dimensional slices. Nevertheless, an understanding of the intrinsic curvature of all eight geome­ tries can be based on the simpler geome­ tries of two-manifolds. The second difference between the twoand three-manifolds might seem to present insurmountable complications . . It is possible to combine three-mani­ folds in such a way as to yield new three­ manifolds that cannot be given a local­ ly homogeneous geometry. Fortunately, topologists know how to split a three­ manifold into primitive pieces by purely topological methods. O of us (Thurston) has proposed that after a three-manifold has been cut up into its primitive pieces, each of the resulting pieces does in fact admit a locally homogeneous geometry of one of the eight possible types. The conjec­ ture has been proved for wide classes of manifolds, and it has been empirically tested for many other examples either by hand or with the aid of a computer, and it has never been found wanting. It now seems unlikely a counterexample will be found. The empirical studies also suggest that for most three-manifolds the com­ plications of three-manifold geometry do not come into play. Indeed, it has been proved that, in a certain technical sense of the word, ","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1038/SCIENTIFICAMERICAN0784-108","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"related_articles_were_imported":false,"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-08-02T13:13:07.087Z"},"cited_articles":[]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6107ef63b023a101bc07fbe1"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"hzwKkB8qSd+FWk1bdWNHfA==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"Characteristic classes of surface bundles","authors":["S.

The homeomorphism rp is pseudo-Anosov iff there is a pair of transverse measured geodesic laminations /i” and AU which intersect each closed nonperipheral geodesic in h4, which are (topologically) preserved by cp and which have their respective transverse measures multiplied under the action of CP by l/n and d for some L > 1.

Given a compact, connected, oriented 3-manifold, when does there exist a codimension-1 transversely oriented foliation 7 which is transverse to dM and has no Reeb components? If such an 7 exists dM necessarily is a (possibly empty) union of tori and M is either SxS (and 7 is the product foliation) or irreducible. The first condition follows by Euler characteristic reasons while the latter basically follows from the work of Reeb [Re] and Novikov [N] although first observed by Rosenberg [Ro]. Our main result says that such conditions are sufficient when Ü2(M, dM) # 0.

At that time the Bulletin did not accept research announcements, and after a couple of attempts to publish it, I gave up, and the preprint did not find a home. I very soon saw that there were many ramifications of this theory, and I talked extensively about it in a number of places. One year I devoted my graduate course to this theory, and notes of Bill Floyd and Michael Handel from that course were circulated for a while. The participants in a seminar at Orsay in 1976-1977 went over this material, and wrote a volume [FLP] including some original material as well. Another good general reference, from a somewhat different point of view, is a set of notes of lectures by A. Casson, taken by S. Bleiler [CasBlei]. There are by now several alternative ways to develop the classification of diffeomorphisms of surfaces described here. At the time I originally discovered the classification of diffeomorphism of surfaces, I was unfamiliar with two bodies of mathematics which were quite relevant: first, Riemann surfaces, quasiconformal maps and Teichmiiller's theory; and second, Nielsen's theory of the dynamical behavior of surface at infinity, and his near-understanding of geodesic laminations. After hearing about the classification of surface automorphisms from the point of view of the space of measured foliations, Lipman Bers [Bersl] developed a proof of the classification of surface automorphisms from the point of view of Teichmüller theory, generalizing Teichmiiller's theorem by allowing the Riemann surface to vary as well as the map. Dennis Sullivan first told me of some neglected articles by Nielsen which might be relevant. This point of view has been discussed by R. Miller, J. Gilman, M. Handel and me. The analogous theory, of measured laminations and 2-dimensional train tracks in three dimensions, has been considerable development. This has been applied to reinterpret some of Haken's work, to classify incompressible surfaces in particular classes of 3-manifolds in papers by me, Hatcher, Floyd, Oertel and others in various combinations. Shalen, Morgan, Culler and others have developed the related theory of groups acting on trees, and its relation to measured laminations, to define and analyze compactifications of representation spaces of groups in SL(2, C) and SO(n, 1); this has many interesting applications, including the theory of incompressible surfaces in 3-manifolds.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1090/S0273-0979-1988-15685-6","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"related_articles_were_imported":false,"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-08-02T13:13:18.648Z"},"cited_articles":[]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6107ef6eb023a101bc07fbf2"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"5fuZr3SpQtS6UFwRAiwzhw==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"Solvgroups are not almost convex","authors":["J.

This paper gives necessary conditions for the existence of such tilings using boundary invariants, which are combinatorial group-theoretic invariants associated to the boundaries of the tile shapes and the regions to be tiled. Boundary invariants are used to solve problems concerning the tiling of triangular-shaped regions of hexagons in the hexagonal lattice with certain tiles consisting of three hexagons. Boundary invariants give stronger conditions for nonexistence of tilings than those obtainable by weighting or coloring arguments. This is shown by considering whether or not a region has a signed tiling, which is a placement of tiles assigned weights 1 or −1, such that all cells in the region are covered with total weight 1 and all cells outside with total weight 0. Any coloring (or weighting) argument that proves nonexistence of a tiling of a region also proves nonexistence of any signed tiling of the region as well. A partial converse holds: if a simply connected region has no signed tiling by simply connected tiles, then there is a generalized coloring argument proving that no signed tiling exists. There exist regions possessing a signed tiling which can be shown to have no perfect tiling using boundary invariants.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1016/0097-3165(90)90057-4","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"related_articles_were_imported":false,"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-08-02T13:13:19.496Z"},"cited_articles":[]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6107ef6fb023a101bc07fbf4"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"AvxalJkmQ/uSBbPAO90R1g==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"Conway's tiling groups","authors":["W.

The idea is that the tiles can be interpreted as describing relators in a group, in such a way that the plane region can be tiled, only if the group element which describes the boundary of the region is the trivial element 1. A convenient way to describe the construction is by means of the Cayley graph or graph of a group. If G is a group, then its graph F(G) with respect to generators g1, g2 . . ., gn is a directed graph whose vertices are the elements of the group. For each vertex v E F(G), there will be n outgoing edges, labeled by the generators, and n incoming edges: the edge labeled gi connects v to vgi. It is convenient to make a slight modification of this picture when a generator gi has order 2. In that case, instead of drawing an arrow from v to vgi and another arrow from vgi back to v, we draw a single undirected edge labeled gi. Thus, in a drawing of the graph of a group, if there are any undirected edges, it is understood that the corresponding generator has order 2. The graph of a group is automatically homogeneous: for every element g E G, the transformation v -4 gv is an automorphism of the graph. Every automorphism of the labeled graph has this form. This property characterizes graphs of groups: a graph whose edges are labeled by a finite set F such that there is exactly one incoming and one outgoing edge with each label at each vertex is the graph of a group if and only if it admits an automorphism taking any vertex to any other. Whenever R is a relator for the group, that is, a word in the generators which represents 1, then if you start from v EF rand trace out R, you get back to v again.

Consider, for example, a hyperbolic 3-manifold N homeomorphic to S x R where S is a closed surface of genus g > 1. Thurston and Bonahon showed how to fill the convex hull of N with “pleated surfaces” homotopic to the obvious map S -+ S x {0} (see Sections 2.3, 2.4) and these surfaces have induced metrics which determine points in the Teichmiiller space r(S) of conformal (or hyperbolic) structures on S. It has been conjectured that the locus of these points is related in an approximate way to a geodesic in F(S), and this is known to be true for a class of examples arising from hyperbolic structures on surface bundles over a circle (see [S]). This kind of information has implications concerning the geometry of N, which will be discussed more fully in a forthcoming paper ([25]). From a more differential-geometric point of view, one can consider, for any metric 0 on S, a mapf, : S -+ N of least “energy” (see Section 3) in the above homotopy class. This least energy is then some function 8(c), andf, is a harmonic map. One can then ask about the locus of points [o] in 3(S) where 8 is bounded above by a given constant, and its relationship to the above set of metrics induced from pleated surfaces. We give here a proof of the following result in this direction, where the crucial restrictive hypothesis we need to make is a positive lower bound on the injectivity radius inj,(x) for all x E N.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1016/0040-9383(93)90013-L","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"related_articles_were_imported":false,"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-08-02T13:13:27.640Z"},"cited_articles":[]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6107ef77b023a101bc07fbfa"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"BKF23hCBTEijGS9DaTGMZA==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"A characterization of compact convex polyhedra in hyperbolic 3-space","authors":["C.

Roughly speaking, we show how to construct a canonical future complete one, Yρ, among all such spacetimes sharing a same holonomy ρ. We study the geometry of Yρ in terms of its canonical cosmological time (CT). In particular we study the asymptotic behaviour of the level surfaces of the cosmological time. The present work generalizes the case n = 2 treated in [11] taking from [4] the emphasis on the fundamental role played by the canonical cosmological time. In particular Mess showed that if F is a closed surface of genus g ≥ 2 then the linear holonomies of the Lorentzian flat structures on R × F such that {0} × F is a spacelike surface are faithful and discrete representations of π1(F ) in SO (2, 1). Moreover he proved that every representation φ : π1(F ) → Iso(M3) whose linear part is faithful and discrete is a holonomy for some Lorentzian structure on R×F such that {0}×F is a spacelike surface. In particular he showed that there exists a unique maximal future complete convex domain of M3, called domain of dependence, which is φ(π1(F ))-invariant such that the quotient is a globally hyperbolic manifold homeomorphic to R × F with regular cosmological time. If we fix the linear holonomy f : π1(F ) → SO(2, 1) these domains (and so the affine deformations of the representation f) are parametrized by the measured geodesic laminations on H/f(π1(F )). The link between domains of dependence and measured geodesic laminations is the Gauss map of the CT-level surfaces. On the other hand Benedetti and Guadagnini noticed in [4] the singularity in the past of a domain of dependence is a real tree which is dual to the lamination. Moreover they argued that the action of π1(F ) on the CT-level surface Sa = T −1(a) converges in the Gromov sense to the action of π1(F ) on the singularity for a → 0 and to the action of π1(F ) on the hyperbolic plane","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.4310/JDG/1122493997","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"related_articles_were_imported":false,"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-08-02T13:13:49.107Z"},"cited_articles":[]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6107ef8db023a101bc07fc16"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"AIl/opNSRTegQBMlcRqZUQ==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"Moduli spaces of local systems and higher Teichmüller theory","authors":["V.

When S have holes, we defined two moduli spaces closely related to the moduli spaces of G-local systems on S. We show that they carry a lot of interesting structures. In particular we define a distinguished collection of coordinate systems, equivariant under the action of the mapping class group of S. We prove that their transition functions are subtraction free. Thus we have positive structures on these moduli spaces. Therefore we can take their points with values in any positive semifield. Their positive real points provide the two higher Teichmüller spaces related to G and S, while the points with values in the tropical semifields provide the lamination spaces.

This includes, for arbitrary curvatures, parameterizations in terms of suitable measured geodesic laminations on open hyperbolic surfaces of finite type. The same geometric objects also parameterize complex projective structures on the surfaces. The coincidence of such parameter space is explained by means of geometric correlations between spacetimes of different curvatures and projective surfaces realized via canonical WR-rescaling along the cosmological times.

They provide a charming concrete access to a special topic of arithmetic geometry: Curves defined over number fields can be described by such simple combina-torial objects as graphs embedded into topological surfaces. Dessins d'enfants are in some sense an answer of Grothendieck to the beautiful Theorem of Belyi, which characterises curves defined over number fields by the existence of certain coverings of the projective line. Grothendieck was fascinated by the fact that such a covering is completely determined by the preimage of the real interval [0, 1] and called this a dessin d'enfants. As one consequence that especially attracted people one has an action of the absolute Galois group Gal(Q/Q) on the set of dessins which is faithful. Therefore in principle all the information on Gal(Q/Q) is hidden in some mysterious way in these combinatorial objects. The study of dessins d'enfants leads to the Grothendieck-Teichmüller group in which Gal(Q/Q) injects. It is still an open question whether these two groups are equal or not. In the next three sections we introduce dessins d'enfants and the Galois action on them. We begin in Section 2 with a review of the correspondence between closed Riemann surfaces and regular complex projective curves. Since the link between these two fields is an essential tool which is used throughout the whole chapter, we provide a sketch of the proof. In Section 3 we give characterisations of dessins d'enfants in terms of Belyi pairs, graphs embedded into surfaces, ribbon graphs, monodromy homomorphisms and subgroups of the free group on two generators and explain how to get from one of these descriptions to the other. Section 4 is devoted to the action of Gal(Q/Q) on dessins d'enfants. We review some of the known results on faithfulness and Galois invariants and explain how it gives rise to an action on the algebraic fundamental group F 2 of the three-punctured sphere. The explicit description of how Gal (Q/Q) acts on the topological generators leads us to the definition of the Grothendieck-Teichmüller group. We finish the section by indicating Dessins d'enfants and Origami curves 3 how Gal (Q/Q) embeds into this group. In the second part of the chapter we turn to connections between origamis and dessins d'enfants. Similar to the latter, origamis are given by combinato-rial data and define arithmetic objects, more precisely curves in moduli …","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.4171/055","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"related_articles_were_imported":false,"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-08-02T13:14:13.044Z"},"cited_articles":[]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6107efa5b023a101bc07fc34"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"zyRJB4rNTPqs6lq/bcuxcQ==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"Complex projective structures","authors":["D.

In the light of the ending lamination theorem, it suffices to prove that any collection of possible ending invariants is realized by some algebraic limit of geometrically finite hyperbolic manifolds. The ending invariants are either Riemann surfaces or filling laminations supporting Masur domain measured laminations and satisfying some mild additional conditions. With any set of ending invariants we associate a sequence of geometrically finite hyperbolic manifolds and prove that this sequence has a convergent subsequence. We derive the necessary compactness theorem combining the Rips machine with non-existence results for certain small actions on real trees of free products of surface groups and free groups. We prove then that the obtained algebraic limit has the desired conformal boundaries and the property that none of the filling laminations is realized by a pleated surface.

But he was also interested in Thurston's work on surfaces, and he expressed this in his Esquisse d'un programme, his Recoltes et semailles and on other occasions. He introduced the notions of dessin d'enfant, Teichmuller tower, and other related objects, he considered the actions of Γ Q on them or on their etale fundamental groups, and he made conjectures on some natural homomorphisms between the absolute Galois group and the automor-phism groups (or outer automorphism groups) of these objects.

A particular case of this yields the wellknown formula for h(T) when T is a toral automorphism. Introduction. We shall study topological entropy, concentrating on its relation to measure theoretic entropy and algebraic examples. Our topological entropy hd(T) is defined (in §2) for a uniformly continuous map F on a metric space (X, d). In [1] a topological entropy h(T) was defined for a continuous map on a compact topological space; if the space is compact metric then h(T)—hd(T).

It is shown in this paper that the identity component of the group G(M) of all homeomorphisms-of a closed manifold of dimension <3 is (1) simple in the algebraic sense; (2) equal to the group of deformations of M (i.e., the group of homeomorphisms of M isotopic to the identity homeomorphism); (3) open in G(M). The proofs for dimensions 2 and 3 are given separately; the proof for dimension 1, the circle, is not given here, but can be modeled after the proof for dimension 2. Theorem 9 of this paper (the main tool in obtaining the above results in the case n = 3) is very similar to a recent independent result of Kister appearing elsewhere in this journal (see also [1]). It is possible to deduce from the above results that the space of homeomorphisms of M is locally arcwise connected. However, since this is a quite special case of more general theorems of Hamstrom and Dyer [2 ] and Hamstrom [3], we omit the proof. It is also shown in this paper that if n ? 3, then the group of deformations of the sphere S. is of index 2 in G(Sn). Furthermore, we find a characterization of homeomorphisms of degree 1 on a closed orientable manifold M of dimension ?3 which admits a homeomorphism of degree -1. Finally, we conclude as a corollary that if n<! 3, then two homeomorphisms of S. are isotopic if and only if they are homotopic. These two sets of results are related by the following fact. In showing the results of the first paragraph, we show that if M is a closed manifold of dimension _ 3, then a homeomorphism h of M is a deformation if and only if h=hi ... hk where hi is a homeomorphism of M which is the identity outside some internal closed n-cell Fi in M, n =dim M (a closed cell is internal if it lies in an open cell; actually, we do not use all of the internal closed n-cells in M.)

Extending an argument of Macpherson and Neumann, it is shown that if U is a generating set for S as a group, then there exists a positive integer n such that every element of S may be written as a group word of length at most n in the elements of U . Likewise, if U is a generating set for S as a monoid, then there exists a positive integer n such that every element of S may be written as a monoid word of length at most n in the elements of U . Some related questions and recent results are noted, and a brief proof is given of a result of Ore’s on commutators, which is used in the proof of the above result. 1. Introduction, notation, and some lemmas on full moieties In [14, Theorem 1.1], Macpherson and Neumann show that if Ω is an infinite set, then the group S = Sym(Ω) is not the union of a chain of |Ω| or fewer proper subgroups. We will repeat the beautiful proof of that result, with modifications that will allow us to obtain, along with it, the result stated in the abstract. The present section is devoted to obtaining strengthened versions of the lemmas used in that proof. Following the notation of [14], for Ω an infinite set, Sym(Ω), generally abbreviated to S, will denote the group of all permutations of Ω, and such permutations will be written to the right of their arguments. For subsets Σ ⊆ Ωa ndU ⊆ S ,t he symbol U(Σ) will denote the set of elements of U that stabilize Σ pointwise, and U{Σ} is the set {f ∈ U :Σ f =Σ } .( In [14] this notation is used only for U a subgroup.) A subset Σ ⊆ Ω will be called full with respect to U ⊆ S if the set of permutations of Σ induced by members of U{Σ} is all of Sym(Σ). The cardinality of a set X will be written |X|, and a subset Σ ⊆ Ω will be called a moiety if |Σ| = |Ω| = |Ω − Σ|. Suppose that Σ1 and Σ2 are moieties of Ω whose intersection is also a moiety, and whose union is all of Ω. Then [14, Lemma 2.3] says that if G is a subgroup of S = Sym(Ω) such that Σ1 and Σ2 are both full with respect to G, then G = S. To strengthen this result, we will consider subsets U, V ⊆ S, closed under inverses, such that Σ1 is full with respect to U and Σ2 with respect to V . By the lemma cited, � U ∪ V � = S; our version of this result will bound the number of factors from U and V needed to obtain the general element of S. Our proof will use the following fact, first proved by Ore [18]. Much stronger results have been proved since. In § 4 we will give a self-contained proof of a statement of intermediate strength.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1112/S0024609305018308","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"related_articles_were_imported":false,"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-08-02T13:19:35.784Z"},"cited_articles":[]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6107f0e7b023a101bc07fc7a"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"mb1lLFUOTU2MmfESjtpvhA==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"Embedding Theorems for Groups","authors":["G.

It was first used by Hamilton in 1853 under the name of “Linear and Vector Functions”. Cay ley used the term matrix in 1854, and developed the basic notions of the theory in 1858 without recognising the relation of his work to that of Hamilton. The algebra of matrices was rediscovered by Laguerre in 1867 and by Frobenius in 1878. Sylvester wrote a large number of papers on matrices, especially in the years 1882-84. After this, although the subject was never entirely dropped, it certainly seemed for many years to be regarded as of little interest to mathematicians in general. Then suddenly came a change. In 1925 Heisenberg's quantum mechanics created a widespread interest in matrices among physicists and applied mathematicians. It is significant that in the bibliography given at the end of the book under review, the average number of entries for 1853-1924 is 5-3 a year, rising to 18-3 for the years 1925-33, although the basis of selection has been narrowed for the later years.Lectures on Matrices\n By J.

This contact Hofer metric is not left-invariant, but rather depends naturally on the choice of a contact form $\\alpha,$ whence its restriction to the subgroup of $\\alpha$-strict contactomorphisms is bi-invariant. The non-degeneracy of this metric follows from an analogue of the energy-capacity inequality. We show furthermore that this metric has infinite diameter in a number of cases by investigating its relations to previously defined metrics on the group of contact diffeomorphisms.

We conjecture that any semi-homogeneous subset-controlled quasimorphism on [G,G] can be extended to a homogeneous subset-controlled quasimorphism on G and also give a theorem supporting this conjecture by using a Bavard-type duality theorem on conjugation invariant norms. 1. Problems and results To state our conjecture, we introduce the notion of subset-controlled quasimorphism (partial quasimorphism, pre-quasimorphism) which is a generalization of quasimorphism. Definition 1.1. Let G be a group and let H be a subset of G. We define the fragmentation norm qH with respect to H for an element f of G, qH(f)=min{k; ∃g1 . . . , gk ∈ G, ∃h1, . . . hk ∈ H such that f=g−1 1 h1g1 · · · g−1 k hkgk}. If there is no such decomposition of f as above, we put qH(f) = ∞. H c-generates G if such decomposition as above exists for any f ∈ G. Definition 1.2. Let H, G′ be subgroups of a group G. A function μ : G′ → R is called an H-quasimorphism on G′ if there exists a positive number C such that for any elements f , g of G′, |μ(fg)− μ(f)− μ(g)| < C ·min{qH(f), qH(g)}. μ is called homogeneous if μ(f) = nμ(f) holds for any element f of G′ and any n ∈ Z. μ is called semi-homogeneous if μ(f) = nμ(f) holds for any element f of G′ and any n ∈ Z≥0. Such generalization as above of quasimorphism appeared first in [EP06]. For a symplectic manifold (M,ω), let Ham(M) denote the group of Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms with compact support and (R, ω0), (B , ω0) denote the 2ndimensional Euclidean space, ball with the standard symplectic form, respectively. Let Bn denote the n-braid group and B∞ denote the infinite braid group ⋃ n Bn. We pose the following conjecture. For a group G, let [G,G] denote the commutator subgroup (the subgroup generated by the set {[a, b] = aba−1b−1|a, b ∈ G} of commutators).

In an appendix with Frederic Le Roux we also show, using related techniques, that the group of germs at a point of homeomorphisms of Rn is strongly uniformly simple.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.2140/gt.2016.20.3033","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"related_articles_were_imported":false,"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-08-02T13:23:42.912Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"U/Ly+mmDQUeLq7ylnahYsg==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6107f1dfb023a101bc07fcd9"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"+NJMMHUWQ5ChaefvcsFsxA==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"The autonomous norm on $${\\text {Ham}}\\left( {\\mathbf R}^{2n} \\right) $$HamR2n is bounded","authors":["Michael Brandenbursky","J.

In this note we describe less stringent conditions on the Chern class and quantum homology of M under which the (asymptotic) spectral invariants descend to Ham(M,ω). For example, they descend if the quantum multiplication of M is undeformed and H2(M) has rank > 1, or if the minimal Chern number is at least n+ 1 (where dimM = 2n) and the even cohomology of M is generated by divisors. The proofs are based on certain calculations of genus zero Gromov–Witten invariants. As an application, we show that the Hamiltonian group of the one point blow up of T 4 admits a Calabi quasimorphism. Moreover, whenever the (asymptotic) spectral invariants descend it is easy to see that Ham(M,ω) has infinite diameter in the Hofer norm. Hence our results establish the infinite diameter of Ham in many new cases. We also show that the area pseudonorm — a geometric version of the Hofer norm — is nontrivial on the (compactly supported) Hamiltonian group for all noncompact manifolds as well as for a large class of closed manifolds.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.4171/CMH/189","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"related_articles_were_imported":false,"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-08-02T13:23:55.801Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"U/Ly+mmDQUeLq7ylnahYsg==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"MHtb+cvlQ928mwHPfVKx7g==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6107f1ecb023a101bc07fce8"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"PvOQ09OnTBePi6p8ksVoNQ==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"Boundedness of certain automorphism groups of an open manifold","authors":["T.

The reason could be in one or more of four categories: something about the location of the target caused the starter to think of his or her choice; the occupation of the target was responsible for the choice; the ethnicity of the target; or some other, unspecified, reason. Six main conclusions may be drawn from the data: (1) A mean of 210 choices per starter account for the “world” (i.e. the 1267 targets). This number is probably an underestimate. Only 35 choices are necessary to account for half the world, however. Of the 210, 95 (45%) were chosen most often for location reasons, 99 (47%) were chosen most often for occupation reasons, and only 7% of the choices were mainly based on ethnicity or other reasons. (2) Choices were mainly friends and acquaintances, with strong cleavage by sex. For any given target, the type of choice used by the majority of starters was a friend or acquaintance, and not family. For any given target, the most likely sex of the choice (i.e. over all starters) can be predicted accurately on 82% of occasions. This sex tends to be male, unless both starter and target are female, or if the target has a low-status occupation. Additionally, any given starter is most likely to pick a male choice for any target, except for the female starter-female target combination, when female choices are more likely. This was correct on 64% of occasions. (3) Location was the usual reason for choice (out of the four categories), with occupation second, and ethnicity or other reasons rarely used. This most popular reason for choice may be correctly predicted for any given target 81% of the time. (4) The decision as to which choice was made appears to depend primarily on the occupation of the target, and secondly on the distance (near/far) from Morgantown, West Virginia, where the experiment took place. (5) The expression “having one's man in …” can be partially quantified. We may define a choice to “handle” a state in the U.S. if he or she was chosen for two-thirds or more of the targets in that state for which choices were made on the basis of location. Then, for any starter, on average, half the states are each handled by a single choice. (6) The accuracy of starters' recall about their networks is low, in the sense that their recall is incorrect more often than it is correct (i.e. their recall could not be put to any other use with any reliability). This confirms previous experiments on informant accuracy.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1016/0378-8733(78)90018-7","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"related_articles_were_imported":false,"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-08-02T13:23:59.150Z"},"cited_articles":[]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6107f1efb023a101bc07fced"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"hIHbAMGYQp+aI9nrFpS3SA==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"The Small World Problem","authors":["S.

At each play, the tree player chooses a spanning tree $T$ and the edge player chooses an edge $e$. The payoff to the edge player is $cost(T,e)$, defined as follows: If $e$ lies in the tree $T$ then $cost(T,e)=0$; if $e$ does not lie in the tree then $cost(T,e) = cycle(T,e)/w(e)$, where $w(e)$ is the weight of edge $e$ and $cycle(T,e)$ is the weight of the unique cycle formed when edge $e$ is added to the tree $T$. The main result is that the value of the game on any $n$-vertex graph is bounded above by $\\exp(O(\\sqrt{\\log n \\log\\log n}))$. It is conjectured that the value of the game is $O(\\log n)$. \nThe game arises in connection with the $k$-server problem on a road network; i.e., a metric space that can be represented as a multigraph $G$ in which each edge $e$ represents a road of length $w(e)$. It is shown that, if the value of the game on $G$ is $Val(G,w)$, then there is a randomized strategy that achieves a competitive ratio of $k(1 + Val(G,w))$ against any oblivious adversary. Thus, on any $n$-vertex road network, there is a randomized algorithm for the $k$-server problem that is $k\\cdot\\exp(O(\\sqrt{\\log n \\log\\log n}))$ competitive against oblivious adversaries. \nAt the heart of the analysis of the game is an algorithm that provides an approximate solution for the simple network design problem. Specifically, for any $n$-vertex weighted, connected multigraph, the algorithm constructs a spanning tree $T$ such that the average, over all edges $e$, of $cost(T,e)$ is less than or equal to $\\exp(O(\\sqrt{\\log n \\log\\log n}))$. This result has potential application to the design of communication networks. It also improves substantially known estimates concerning the existence of a sparse basis for the cycle space of a graph.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1137/S0097539792224474","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"related_articles_were_imported":false,"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-08-02T13:24:00.694Z"},"cited_articles":[]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6107f1f3b023a101bc07fcf1"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"+OYh/atMRrSPHVAztcts+g==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"The Death of Distance","authors":["H.

We argue that there is one nontrivial length-scale in the model, analogous to the correlation length in other systems, which is well-defined in the limit of infinite system size and which diverges continuously as the randomness in the network tends to zero, giving a normal critical point in this limit. This length-scale governs the crossover from large- to small-world behavior in the model, as well as the number of vertices in a neighborhood of given radius on the network. We derive the value of the single critical exponent controlling behavior in the critical region and the finite size scaling form for the average vertex-vertex distance on the network, and, using series expansion and Padé approximants, find an approximate analytic form for the scaling function. We calculate the effective dimension of small-world graphs and show that this dimension varies as a function of the length-scale on which it is measured, in a manner reminiscent of multifractals. We also study the problem of site percolation on small-world networks as a simple model of disease propagation, and derive an approximate expression for the percolation probability at which a giant component of connected vertices first forms (in epidemiological terms, the point at which an epidemic occurs). The typical cluster radius satisfies the expected finite size scaling form with a cluster size exponent close to that for a random graph. All our analytic results are confirmed by extensive numerical simulations of the model.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1103/PhysRevE.60.7332","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"related_articles_were_imported":false,"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-08-02T13:24:04.070Z"},"cited_articles":[]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6107f1f4b023a101bc07fcf3"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"/WOSwfI7SuCUG+qBDGS6SQ==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"Mean-field theory for scale-free random networks","authors":["A.

The decentralized approach appears in a variety of settings: in the behavior of users browsing the Web by following hyperlinks; in the design of focused crawlers [4, 5, 8] and other agents that explore the Web’s links to gather information; and in the search protocols underlying decentralized peer-to-peer systems such as Gnutella [10], Freenet [7], and recent research prototypes [21, 22, 23], through which users can share resources without a central server. In recent work, we have been investigating the problem of decentralized search in large information networks [14, 15]. Our initial motivation was an experiment that dealt directly with the search problem in a decidedly pre-Internet context: Stanley Milgram’s famous study of the small-world phenomenon [16, 17]. Milgram was seeking to determine whether most pairs of people in society were linked by short chains of acquaintances, and for this purpose he recruited individuals to try forwarding a letter to a designated “target” through people they knew on a first-name basis. The starting individuals were given basic information about the target — his name, address, occupation, and a few other personal details — and had to choose a single acquaintance to send the letter to, with goal of reaching the target as quickly as possible; subsequent recipients followed the same procedure, and the chain closed in on its destination. Of the chains that completed, the median number of steps required was six — a result that has since entered popular culture as the “six degrees of separation” principle [11]. Milgram’s experiment contains two striking discoveries — that short chains are pervasive, and that people are able to find them. This latter point is concerned precisely with a type of decentralized navigation in a social network, consisting of people as nodes and links joining","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.7551/mitpress/1120.003.0060","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"related_articles_were_imported":false,"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-08-02T13:24:08.665Z"},"cited_articles":[]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6107f1f9b023a101bc07fcf7"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"eqR7ihrrTfm/muuTrGQRkQ==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"Distribution of Link Distances in a Wireless Network","authors":["L.

Many workers communicate regularly with distant coworkers; some monitor and manipulate tools and objects at a distance. Work teams are spread across different cities or countries. Joint ventures and multiorganizational projects entail work in many locations. Two famous examples--the Hudson Bay Company's seventeenth-century fur trading empire and the electronic community that created the original Linux computer operating system--suggest that distributed work arrangements can be flexible, innovative, and highly successful. At the same time, distributed work complicates workers' professional and personal lives. Distributed work alters how people communicate and how they organize themselves and their work, and it changes the nature of employee-employer relationships. \nThis book takes a multidisciplinary approach to the study of distributed work groups and organizations, the challenges inherent in distributed work, and ways to make distributed work more effective.

The idea is that every node u stores pointers to some nodes called 'neighbors'; these pointers are partitioned into several 'rings', so that for some increasing sequence of balls Bi around u, the neighbors in the i-th ring lie inside Bi; the radii of these balls and the distribution of neighbors in a given ring depend on the specific application. In effect, rings of neighbors represent an overlay network with a certain structure imposed by the balls Bi.

In Taiwan, most of the towers of EHV transmission systems built by Taiwan Power Company (TPC) are located in remote areas and their line topology resembles a long chain. Therefore, the monitoring network designed for the EHV transmission lines cannot easily gain access to energy sources to power its communication nodes and may become fragmented due to any node failure. In view of the challenge, this study proposes a customized routing scheme for EHV transmission line monitoring, named transmission coverage adjustable multi-hop algorithm (TCAMA). TCAMA not only controls transmission power but also performs route selection to minimize power consumption. This algorithm also creates multiple redundant paths to meet the communication performance requirements. To verify the effectiveness of TCAMA, an Internet of Things-based monitoring system has adopted the proposed TCAMA to monitor an actual TPC EHV transmission system to examine its communication network performance. First, a gateway was developed, and a point-to-point transmission experiment was conducted to evaluate the transmission performance of the gateway with different transmission power and distances. Second, the results of the point-to-point experiment served as the transmission parameters in the network simulation, and 150 simulations were conducted. Then, the simulation results were analyzed to determine whether the data packet transmission performance met the communication requirements of a smart grid. Third, the performance of TCAMA was further examined using the distribution and topology of critical EHV transmission lines in Taiwan. Based on the field test results, TCAMA can prevent packet storms and can perform customized tasks using empirical measurements. In addition, TCAMA is capable of achieving 100% packet delivery while maintaining end-to-end communication delay much less than 2000 ms. The delay and energy consumption during the network transmission can also be reduced when TCAMA is employed.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1016/j.ijepes.2020.106394","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"related_articles_were_imported":false,"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-08-02T13:24:23.040Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"C3tPDxiBQfWqJepaMpuwxA==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6107f207b023a101bc07fd0b"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"yyPH0MxpRyGZC1xPwrM/jg==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"Repeated collaboration of inventors across European regions","authors":["Gergo Tóth","S.

We apply the sociological theory of homophily, i.e., the implicit preference for similar others, to hierarchically structured auditor dyads. Our regression analyses reveal that sharing the same gender and the same ethnicity, measured by dialect, increases the likelihood of dyad formation beyond what one would expect based on the characteristics of the pool of available auditors. Further, we observe that forming auditor dyads sharing the same age is avoided, suggesting that the need to establish a legitimate hierarchical relationship through social differentiation represents a boundary condition for homophily. Testing for the consequences of auditor dyad formation using an instrumental variable approach, we find that auditor dyads sharing the same dialect provide lower audit quality. We conclude that homophily matters in auditor dyad formation with potentially adverse consequences for audit quality.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1016/j.aos.2020.101156","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"related_articles_were_imported":false,"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-08-02T13:24:24.451Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"C3tPDxiBQfWqJepaMpuwxA==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6107f20bb023a101bc07fd0e"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"VRLzgQUBRd+xDXsmfkyonA==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"Social autonomy ≠ social empowerment: The social self-restriction model","authors":["H.

Social autonomy enables individuals to connect with preferred social partners and avoid undesirable others. The benefits of social autonomy are undeniable; however, the SSR model makes the novel assertion that people tend to exercise social autonomy in ways that ultimately constrain their potential for social empowerment—a higher-order form of personal freedom. Attaining the ideal of high social empowerment requires both high social autonomy and high social adaptability. People with high social adaptability can feel reasonably comfortable and act competently in social environments they did not choose to inhabit. Unfortunately, people with high social autonomy are unlikely to possess high social adaptability. We propose that social autonomy undermines social adaptability by tempting people to avoid social challenges and socialize selectively with similar others in familiar contexts, a habit that limits social skill development, promotes social intolerance, and distorts social perceptions. In essence, we argue that social autonomy allows people to live in their social comfort zones, at the cost of restricting their social range. Our discussion of the SSR model incorporates evidence and perspectives from a broad range of academic disciplines, and includes consideration of opportunities for future research.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1002/JTS5.97","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"related_articles_were_imported":false,"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-08-02T13:24:27.582Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"C3tPDxiBQfWqJepaMpuwxA==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6107f20cb023a101bc07fd0f"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"7QiELvIIQlOf5Ax8Bch0Sg==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"Inferring Urban Social Networks from Publicly Available Data","authors":["Stefano Guarino","Enrico Mastrostefano","M.

At the same time, the so-called contact networks describe interactions, rather than relationships, and are strongly dependent on the application and on the size and quality of the sample data used to infer them. To fill the gap between these two approaches, we present a data-driven model for urban social networks, implemented and released as open source software. By using just widely available aggregated demographic and social-mixing data, we are able to create, for a territory of interest, an age-stratified and geo-referenced synthetic population whose individuals are connected by “strong ties” of two types: intra-household (e.g., kinship) or friendship. While household links are entirely data-driven, we propose a parametric probabilistic model for friendship, based on the assumption that distances and age differences play a role, and that not all individuals are equally sociable. The demographic and geographic factors governing the structure of the obtained network, under different configurations, are thoroughly studied through extensive simulations focused on three Italian cities of different size.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.3390/fi13050108","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"related_articles_were_imported":false,"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-08-02T13:24:28.178Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"C3tPDxiBQfWqJepaMpuwxA==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6107f20db023a101bc07fd10"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"WlZvY9pOQRWa4mmetXys1g==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"Mapping research networks supported by the National Geographic Society through spatial social networks","authors":["D.

Multicast and anycast are important group communication paradigms for numerous DTN applications. For example, multicast is used to disseminate real-time traffic information reporting and software patch to multiple devices, and anycast is used for resource discovery and information exchange in emergency or crisis situation. While multicast and anycast have been studied extensively in the context of the Internet and Mobile Ad-Hoc Networks (MANETs), efficient multicast and anycast in DTNs are significantly different and challenging problems due to frequent partitions and intermittent connectivity among nodes. In this paper, we propose single-copy routing strategies for multicast and anycast based on the multi-hop delivery probabilities. Multicast employs a dynamic tree branching technique that allows routing paths to be efficiently shared among multicast destinations. Anycast selects relay nodes based on social distances to anycast group members. It balances the trade-off between a short path to the closest, single group member and a longer path to the area where many other group members reside. That is, it optimises both the efficiency and robustness of message delivery. Through extensive simulation studies using a real-world mobility trace, we show that our schemes achieve a high delivery ratio, low delay, and low (or comparable) transmission cost compared to other group communication strategies. Graphical Abstract Multicast routing employs a dynamic tree branching technique that allows routing paths to be efficiently shared among multicast destinations. Anycast routing balances the trade-off between a short path to the closest, single group member and a longer path over which many other group members reside.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1080/17445760.2017.1300802","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"related_articles_were_imported":false,"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-08-02T13:24:32.070Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"C3tPDxiBQfWqJepaMpuwxA==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6107f210b023a101bc07fd13"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"8QtWCx9XTEWYeZi81qx/9A==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"Bridging of different sites by bohemians and tourists: analysis by agent-based simulation","authors":["S.

The geolocation positions were recorded intraday and cover the period from January 1, 2018 to July 17, 2018. The authors concentrate their study on a popular hedge fund trading strategy known as pairs trading. First, the authors collect data regarding Under Armour (UA) and Nike’s stock market price and volume. Second, they investigate the volume of people visiting each physical store of UA and Nike, as proxied from anonymous cell phone geolocation traffic. Third, they monitor the relative activities for tweets related to UA and Nike. Fourth, after combining all the data, the authors glean the following fascinating results: (1) Geolocation information is proven to be an important factor in a pairs trading strategy between UA and Nike, according to the results of feature selection and prediction accuracy for price ratio change; (2) both ensemble methods of machine learning and rolling analysis could significantly raise the prediction accuracy; and (3) a pairs trading strategy incorporating geolocation information can have a cumulative return of 13.72% from January 2018 to June 2018, with an annualized Sharpe ratio of 3.88.

This is an extremely useful feature in training machine learning models that can be used in lucrative pairs-trading strategies. • In the era of big data, it is tempting to throw every feature into a model and assume that the model will always figure out which features are most important. However, the model will usually perform better when trained on a subset of distinct features. • Ensemble methods are an effective means of eliminating bias in machine learning models because they use the output from a series of independently trained submodels to generate one balanced result.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.3905/jfds.2019.1.024","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"related_articles_were_imported":false,"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-08-02T13:24:39.734Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"C3tPDxiBQfWqJepaMpuwxA==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6107f217b023a101bc07fd1a"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"g787Dpp2RJmPYw6mJVo3Tw==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"Similarity in functional brain connectivity at rest predicts interpersonal closeness in the social network of an entire village","authors":["Ryan Hyon","Y.

Here, we characterized the social network of residents of a remote village, a subset of whom contributed personality and neuroimaging data. We demonstrate that similarity in individuals’ resting-state functional connectomes predicts individuals’ proximity in their real-world social network, even when controlling for demographic characteristics and self-reported personality traits. Our results suggest that patterns of functional brain activity during rest encode latent similarities (e.g., in terms of how people think and behave) that are associated with friendship. Taken together, integrating neuroimaging and social network analysis can offer novel insights into how the brain shapes or is shaped by the social networks that it inhabits. People often have the intuition that they are similar to their friends, yet evidence for homophily (being friends with similar others) based on self-reported personality is inconsistent. Functional connectomes—patterns of spontaneous synchronization across the brain—are stable within individuals and predict how people tend to think and behave. Thus, they may capture interindividual variability in latent traits that are particularly similar among friends but that might elude self-report. Here, we examined interpersonal similarity in functional connectivity at rest—that is, in the absence of external stimuli—and tested if functional connectome similarity is associated with proximity in a real-world social network. The social network of a remote village was reconstructed; a subset of residents underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging. Similarity in functional connectomes was positively related to social network proximity, particularly in the default mode network. Controlling for similarities in demographic and personality data (the Big Five personality traits) yielded similar results. Thus, functional connectomes may capture latent interpersonal similarities between friends that are not fully captured by commonly used demographic or personality measures. The localization of these results suggests how friends may be particularly similar to one another. Additionally, geographic proximity moderated the relationship between neural similarity and social network proximity, suggesting that such associations are particularly strong among people who live particularly close to one another. These findings suggest that social connectivity is reflected in signatures of brain functional connectivity, consistent with the common intuition that friends share similarities that go beyond, for example, demographic similarities.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1073/pnas.2013606117","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"related_articles_were_imported":false,"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-08-02T13:24:39.736Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"C3tPDxiBQfWqJepaMpuwxA==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6107f217b023a101bc07fd1b"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"eudpaaD9RJ+/fxbX/pSn7w==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"Identification of Information Networks in Stock Markets","authors":["M.

However, the estimation of investor information networks remains an important and challenging task because the existing network inference methodologies lack the ability to explicitly account for the impact of public information on investor trading decisions. We address this gap by proposing a new framework to estimate private information channels in stock markets. In our approach, the impact of public information on investors' trading events is filtered out from investors' transactions. This allows us to reveal their co-behavior driven by the transfer of private information. Our results show that taking public information into account when inferring investor networks significantly changes their topology and strengthens the relationship between investor's network centrality and returns. Therefore, we believe that our approach leads to a more precise representation of the information network. Furthermore, we find that the association between centrality and returns becomes stronger and both statistically and economically more significant. Moreover, investigating the properties of information networks, we observe that the physical distances between connected investors begin to shrink when network links are validated using harsh thresholds.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.2139/ssrn.3750035","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"related_articles_were_imported":false,"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-08-02T13:24:39.819Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"C3tPDxiBQfWqJepaMpuwxA==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6107f217b023a101bc07fd1c"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"4iTPGEygRAOoWUIGIfLmug==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"The impact of node arrival process and stochastic edge growth on scale-free distribution in complex networks","authors":["F.

Consequently, some scholars refined and extended the BA model among which non-linear preferential attachment (NLPA), dynamical edge rewiring, fitness models and other growth models presented in the literature. In a network, features like how individuals enter the network, the probability distribution of edge growth, and the probability distribution of nodes’ age have considerable significance. A key question that neglects in the BA model is that ‘Can LPA phenomenon basically generate SF graphs apart from the arrival process of nodes and the probability distribution of nodes’ age?’. In this paper, we demonstrate the resulted graphs belong to the class of small-world or random networks contrary to the employ of LPA in the proposed model. Hence, what neglect in the BA model prevents us from attaining a clear interpretation of all properties of real-world networks.

In terms of social networks, geographical location is actively shared by users. In some applications with recommendation services, before the geographical location recommendation is provided, the authors have to obtain user's permission. This kind of social network integrated with geographical location information is called location-based social networks (abbreviate for LBSNs). In the LBSN, each user has location information when he or she checked in hotels or feature spots. Based on this information, they can identify user's trajectory of movement behaviour and activity patterns.

Due to the inherent spatial and networked characteristics of UBNs, research on the spatial configuration of UBNs requires a comprehensive approach involving the integration of spatial and network analysis methods. We propose a methodological framework for geospatial network analysis that combines spatial and network analysis to analyse the spatial configuration of UBNs. This framework is based on the construction of an urban bus spatial network (UBSN) in which the network nodes are spatial division units of urban space with more realistic geographical significance. Then, the framework analyses the spatial configuration of the UBN from the identification of macroscopic statistical characteristics to reveal the explicit roles played by microscopic elements such as individual nodes and to further identify the mesoscopic structural organization. The importance of nodes has spatial heterogeneity and directional imbalance. The community detection results demonstrate the UBSN presents obvious spatial agglomeration features, and the overlapping nodes are mostly distributed in the suburbs. With a novel viewpoint and detailed description of the spatial configuration of UBNs, this study provides meaningful insights for policy makers and planners seeking to optimize traffic infrastructure planning.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1016/J.CITIES.2019.102406","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"related_articles_were_imported":false,"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-08-02T13:24:43.332Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"C3tPDxiBQfWqJepaMpuwxA==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6107f21bb023a101bc07fd21"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"13x1l0BRTiK/KRUX6o1k/w==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"A Temporal User Attribute-Based Algorithm to Detect Communities in Online Social Networks","authors":["Amin Mahmoudi","A.

The existing community detection algorithms are mostly edge-based and are evaluated using the modularity metric benchmarks. However, these algorithms have two inherent limitations. Firstly, they are based on a pure mathematical object which considers the number of connections in each community as the main measures. Consequently, a resolution limit and low accuracy in finding community members in often observed. Whereas, online social networks are dynamic networks and the key players are humans whose main attributes such as lifespan, geo-location, the density of interactions, and user weight, change over time. These attributes tend to influence the formation of user communities in any category of online social network. Secondly, the output structure of existing community detection algorithms is usually provided as a graph and dendrogram. A graph structure, is, however, characterized by a high memory complexity, and subsequently exponential search time complexity. Implementing dendrogram such a complex structure is complicated. To address memory complexity and the accuracy rate of the community detection issues, this paper proposes a new temporal user attribute-based algorithm, namely the recently largest interaction based on the attributes of a typical online social network user. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms eight well-known algorithms in this domain.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3018941","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"related_articles_were_imported":false,"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-08-02T13:24:43.581Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"C3tPDxiBQfWqJepaMpuwxA==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6107f21cb023a101bc07fd22"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"ZR3bwS0bQg+cjIAnYfl7dQ==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"The spatial variation of switching rates in large cooperative membership bases: empirical evidence from the dairy sector","authors":["T.

We constructed weighted spatial networks representing tie strength between geographical areas, then modeled tie formation as a function of socio-economic and demographic dissimilarity between areas. Physical and virtual tie formation were affected by income, age, and race differences, although these effects were smaller by an order of magnitude than the geographical distance effect. Tie formation was more frequent when “destination” area had higher median income and lower median age. We hypothesise that physical tie formation is more “costly” than a virtual one, resulting in stronger segregation in the physical world. Economic and cultural motives may result in stronger segregation of relatively rich and young populations from their surroundings.

To address this question, we analyze Web of Science (WoS) data on international collaboration between global leader cities in science production. We report an increasing intensity of international city-city collaboration and find that average distance of collaboration of the strongest connections has slightly increased, but distance decay has remained stable over the last three decades. However, high-impact collaborations span large distances by following similar distance decay. This finding suggests that a larger geographical reach of research collaboration should be aimed for to support high-impact science.

For example, transportation networks (such as railways), communication networks (such as Internet routers), and biological networks (such as fungal foraging networks) are all spatially embedded. Both the density of interactions (presence of edges) and intensity of interactions (edge weights) are typically found to decrease as a function of spatial separation of nodes in these networks. Communication and mobility of groups of individuals have also been shown to decline with their spatial separation, and the so-called gravity model postulates that this decline takes the form of a power-law holding at all distances. There is however some evidence that the rate of decline might change as the distance increases beyond a certain value, called a change point, but there have been few statistically principled methods for determining the existence and location of change points or assessing the change in intensity of interactions associated with them. We introduce such a method within the Bayesian paradigm and apply it to anonymized mobile call detail records (CDRs). Our results are potentially useful in settings where understanding social and spatial mixing of people is important, such as in the design of cluster randomized trials for studying interventions for infectious diseases, but we also anticipate the method to be useful for investigating more generally how distance may affect tie strengths in general in spatially embedded networks.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1038/s41598-020-68583-1","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"related_articles_were_imported":false,"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-08-02T13:24:46.550Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"C3tPDxiBQfWqJepaMpuwxA==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6107f21fb023a101bc07fd26"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"Wson+t2IQWG8S98ZNxx1pA==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"The role of geography in the complex diffusion of innovations","authors":["B.

Improved understanding of innovation diffusion across locations and through social connections can provide us with new insights into the spread of information, technological progress and economic development. In this work, we analyze the spatial adoption dynamics of iWiW, an Online Social Network (OSN) in Hungary and uncover empirical features about the spatial adoption in social networks. During its entire life cycle from 2002 to 2012, iWiW reached up to 300 million friendship ties of 3 million users. We find that the number of adopters as a function of town population follows a scaling law that reveals a strongly concentrated early adoption in large towns and a less concentrated late adoption. We also discover a strengthening distance decay of spread over the life-cycle indicating high fraction of distant diffusion in early stages but the dominance of local diffusion in late stages. The spreading process is modelled within the Bass diffusion framework that enables us to compare the differential equation version with an agent-based version of the model run on the empirical network. Although both model versions can capture the macro trend of adoption, they have limited capacity to describe the observed trends of urban scaling and distance decay. We find, however that incorporating adoption thresholds, defined by the fraction of social connections that adopt a technology before the individual adopts, improves the network model fit to the urban scaling of early adopters. Controlling for the threshold distribution enables us to eliminate the bias induced by local network structure on predicting local adoption peaks. Finally, we show that geographical features such as distance from the innovation origin and town size influence prediction of adoption peak at local scales in all model specifications.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1038/s41598-020-72137-w","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"related_articles_were_imported":false,"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-08-02T13:24:47.984Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"C3tPDxiBQfWqJepaMpuwxA==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6107f220b023a101bc07fd27"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"UtiCsODZRdeLftV+OEosGw==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"Friend Recommendation Decision Systems via Multiple Social Network Alignment","authors":["A.

Much effort has been devoted to investigating residential segregation, mostly over well-defined social groups (e.g. race). Little is known of how mobility and human communications affect urban social integration. The dynamics of spatial and social-network segregation and individual variations along these two dimensions are largely untapped. In this article, we put forward a computational framework based on coupling large-scale information on human mobility, social-network connections and people’s socio-economic status (SES), to provide a breakthrough in our understanding of the dynamics of spatio-temporal and social-network segregation in cities. Building on top of a social similarity measure, the framework can be used to depict segregation dynamics down to the individual level, and also provide aggregate measurements at the scale of places and cities, and their evolution over time. By applying the methodology in Singapore using large-scale mobile phone and socio-economic datasets, we find a relatively higher level of segregation among relatively wealthier classes, a finding that holds for both social and physical space. We also highlight the interplay between the effect of distance decay and homophily as forces that determine communication intensity, defining a notion of characteristic ‘homophily distance’ that can be used to measure social segregation across cities. The time-resolved analysis reveals the changing landscape of urban segregation and the time-varying roles of places. Segregations in physical and social space are weakly correlated at the individual level but highly correlated when grouped across at least hundreds of individuals. The methodology and analysis presented in this paper enable a deeper understanding of the dynamics of human segregation in social and physical space, which can assist social scientists, planners and city authorities in the design of more integrated cities.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1098/rsif.2019.0536","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"related_articles_were_imported":false,"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-08-02T13:24:48.352Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"C3tPDxiBQfWqJepaMpuwxA==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6107f220b023a101bc07fd29"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"A2c14jXFSkWAoe4v0APv5A==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"Exploiting Social Network Characteristics for Efficient Routing in Ocean Vessel Ad Hoc Networks","authors":["Qihang Bing","Ruobing Jiang","Feng Hong"],"date":{"$date":"2019-08-02T00:00:00.000Z"},"pdf_url":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8958733","abstract":"Communication in the ocean vessel wireless ad hoc networks which currently rely on shore-based cellular stations, is expensive and can only be used near the coast. It is a big challenge for ocean vessels to achieve economic and large-scope communications, due to the rare encounter opportunities and highly dynamic vessel mobilities. Previous works on routing algorithms for vessel wireless ad hoc networks did not take into account the social characteristics of ocean vessel networks. According to our empirical study on real trajectories of more than 7,000 ocean vessel recorded by the Vessel Monitoring System (VMS), we have made innovative observations. Firstly, there exist stable social connections among those vessels frequently encounter with each other. Moreover, stable social communities can be discovered for those ocean vessels with long-term connections. Inspired by the significant observations, two unicast routing approaches based on social society characteristics are proposed for wireless ocean vessel ad hoc networks, i.e., familiarity based routing (FBR) and community based routing (CBR). The key metric for message forwarding decision making of FBR is the expected multi-hop encounter probability of the potential forwarder with the message receiver. The expected multi-hop encounter probability is derived from the raised definition of familiarity, which measures the connection strengths between vessels. The proposed CBR forwards messages based on the metric of inter-community betweenness centrality of a potential forwarder, which describes the bridge capability between two communities. Extensive trace-driven simulations based on real ocean vessel trajectories are performed and the evaluation results demonstrate the significant performance achieved by the proposed approaches. The transmission cost has been largely reduced with comparable delivery ratio and delay.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1109/IPCCC47392.2019.8958733","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"related_articles_were_imported":false,"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-08-02T13:24:48.454Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"C3tPDxiBQfWqJepaMpuwxA==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6107f220b023a101bc07fd2a"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"tTfrgqvAR2qK5lHnZC3XjQ==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"Friend recommendation in social networks based on multi-source information fusion","authors":["Shulin Cheng","Bofeng Zhang","Guobing Zou","Mingqing Huang","Zhu Zhang"],"date":{"$date":"2019-08-02T00:00:00.000Z"},"pdf_url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/S13042-017-0778-1","abstract":"Friend recommendation (FR) in social networks has been widely studied in recent years, which mainly focuses on social relationships and user interests.

In fact, being friends among users is either determined by one or two dominant factors that originate from varying information sources, or the results of multiple main factors gaming. Motivated by the observations above, we propose a scalable FR framework in social networks, where multiple sources have been integrated based on improved D-S evidence theory. More specifically, we first analyzed 7 valuable information sources and categorized them into three classes, including Personal Features, Network Structure Features and Social Features. Furthermore, we also propose a fusion recommendation framework based on D-S evidence theory which embodies the minimal conflicts among evidences. In the proposed method, we first optimize the framework by importance degree and reliability of evidence based on original D-S evidence theory. Then, we designed a novel BPA evidence function by quantifying the evidence, where each evidence measures the relevance of forming friends among users. Finally, we describe the fusion FR algorithm plugged into our recommendation framework. The experiments on real-world dataset show that our proposed approach outperforms the other state-of-the-art algorithms on five evaluation metrics.

Therefore, DAS disseminates only a few message copies to ensure data delivery as well as reducing routing cost. We conduct extensive simulations using real trace data sets to show improved performance with low overhead in comparison with existing social-aware routing approaches in various scenarios.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1007/S11276-018-01907-2","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"related_articles_were_imported":false,"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-08-02T13:24:52.616Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"C3tPDxiBQfWqJepaMpuwxA==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6107f225b023a101bc07fd2e"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"0dGvPL9TTc+vqlYt0ILZEw==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"What Is the Entropy of a Social Organization?","authors":["C.

To this end, we propose a popularity scaled latent space model for the large-scale directed network structure formulation.

As a consequence, the reciprocity and transitivity properties can be analytically derived. In addition to that, we assume for each node a popularity parameter. Those nodes with larger (smaller) popularity are more (less) likely to be followed by other nodes. By assuming different distributions for popularity parameters, different types of degree heterogeneity can be modeled. Furthermore, based on the proposed model, a comprehensive probabilistic index is constructed for link prediction. Its finite sample performance is demonstrated by extensive simulation studies and a Sina Weibo (a Twitter-type social network in China) dataset.

Knowing all the features that influence such ties is very important for many related domains such as location-based recommender systems and community and event detection systems for online social networks (OSNs). In recent years, researchers have analyzed the role of user geo-location in OSNs. Researchers have also attempted to determine the probability of friendships being established based on distance, where friendship is not only a function of distance. However, some important features of OSNs remain unknown. In order to comprehensively understand the OSN phenomenon, we also need to analyze users’ attributes. Basically, an OSN functions according to four main user properties: user geo-location, user weight, number of user interactions, and user lifespan. The research presented here sought to determine whether the user mobility pattern can be used to predict users’ interaction behavior. It also investigated whether, in addition to distance, the number of friends (known as user weight) interferes in social network tie formation. To this end, we analyzed the above-stated features in three large-scale OSNs. We found that regardless of a high degree freedom in user mobility, the fraction of the number of outside activities over the inside activity is a significant fraction that helps us to address the user interaction behavior. To the best of our knowledge, research has not been conducted elsewhere on this issue. We also present a high-resolution formula in order to improve the friendship probability function.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1145/3314204","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"related_articles_were_imported":false,"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-08-02T13:24:56.293Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"C3tPDxiBQfWqJepaMpuwxA==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6107f229b023a101bc07fd31"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"1VRYeJ2+TwCip/P8GJGAbw==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"Human mobility in bike-sharing systems: Structure of local and non-local dynamics","authors":["D.

In this paper, we study the global activity of users in bike-sharing systems operating in the cities of Chicago and New York. For this transportation mode, we explore the temporal and spatial characteristics of the mobility of cyclists. In particular, through the analysis of origin-destination matrices, we characterize the spatial structure of the displacements of users. We apply a mobility model for the global activity of the system that classifies the displacements between stations in local and non-local transitions. In local transitions, cyclists move in a region around each station whereas, in the non-local case, bike users travel with long-range displacements in a similar way to Lévy flights. We reproduce the spatial dynamics by using Monte Carlo simulations. The obtained results are similar to the observed in real data and reveal that the model implemented captures important characteristics of the global spatial dynamics in the systems analyzed.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1371/journal.pone.0213106","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"related_articles_were_imported":false,"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-08-02T13:24:57.668Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"C3tPDxiBQfWqJepaMpuwxA==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6107f229b023a101bc07fd32"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"sGwkZK/jS86j+pUTnAClnQ==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"Link Prediction in Networks with Core-Fringe Data","authors":["Austin R.

A common example arises in collecting network data: we often obtain network datasets by recording all of the interactions among a small set of core nodes, so that we end up with a measurement of the network consisting of these core nodes along with a potentially much larger set of fringe nodes that have links to the core. Given the ubiquity of this process for assembling network data, it is crucial to understand the role of such a “core-fringe” structure. Here we study how the inclusion of fringe nodes affects the standard task of network link prediction. One might initially think the inclusion of any additional data is useful, and hence that it should be beneficial to include all fringe nodes that are available. However, we find that this is not true; in fact, there is substantial variability in the value of the fringe nodes for prediction. Once an algorithm is selected, in some datasets, including any additional data from the fringe can actually hurt prediction performance; in other datasets, including some amount of fringe information is useful before prediction performance saturates or even declines; and in further cases, including the entire fringe leads to the best performance. While such variety might seem surprising, we show that these behaviors are exhibited by simple random graph models.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1145/3308558.3313626","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"related_articles_were_imported":false,"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-08-02T13:24:57.670Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"C3tPDxiBQfWqJepaMpuwxA==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6107f22ab023a101bc07fd33"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"4xX4f21kSmipJM4a/HY29A==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"Will Scale-Free Popularity Develop Scale-Free Geo-Social Networks?","authors":["D.

Therefore, in this paper we propose a gravity-low-based geo-social network model, where connections develop according to the popularity of the individuals, but are constrained through their geographic distance and the surrounding population density. Specifically, we consider a power-law distributed popularity, and random node positions governed by a Poisson point process. We evaluate the characteristics of the emerging networks, considering the degree distribution, the average degree of neighbors and the local clustering coefficient. These local metrics reflect the robustness of the network, the information dissemination speed and the communication locality. We show that unless the communication range is strictly limited, the emerging networks are scale-free, with a rank exponent affected by the spatial factors. Even the average neighbor degree and the local clustering coefficient show tendencies known in non-geographic scale-free networks, at least when considering individuals with low popularity. At high-popularity values, however, the spatial constraints lead to popularity-independent average neighbor degrees and clustering coefficients.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1109/TNSE.2018.2841942","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"related_articles_were_imported":false,"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-08-02T13:24:58.419Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"C3tPDxiBQfWqJepaMpuwxA==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6107f22cb023a101bc07fd34"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"UEB445oaQgqUxA2zGZ61ZQ==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"Social Network Analysis through Big Data Platform Review","authors":["M.

In this work, we introduce unsupervised pivot translation for distant languages, which translates a language to a distant language through multiple hops, and the unsupervised translation on each hop is relatively easier than the original direct translation. We propose a learning to route (LTR) method to choose the translation path between the source and target languages. LTR is trained on language pairs whose best translation path is available and is applied on the unseen language pairs for path selection. Experiments on 20 languages and 294 distant language pairs demonstrate the advantages of the unsupervised pivot translation for distant languages, as well as the effectiveness of the proposed LTR for path selection. Specifically, in the best case, LTR achieves an improvement of 5.58 BLEU points over the conventional direct unsupervised method.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.18653/v1/P19-1017","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"related_articles_were_imported":false,"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-08-02T13:25:02.010Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"C3tPDxiBQfWqJepaMpuwxA==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6107f22fb023a101bc07fd36"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"rN/fFX9HSP6P8FFYO2fqxw==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"Merging Observed and Self-Reported Behaviour in Agent-Based Simulation: A Case Study on Photovoltaic Adoption","authors":["Andrea Borghesi","M.

However, the addition of spatial information poses new challenges, as nodes are embedded simultaneously in network space and Euclidean space. While nearby nodes may not form social ties, ties may exist at a distance, a configuration ill-suited for traditional spatial metrics that assume adjacent objects are related. As such, there are relatively few metrics to describe these nuanced situations. We advance the burgeoning field of spatial social network analysis by introducing a set of new metrics. Specifically, we introduce the spatial social network schema, tuning parameter and the flattening ratio, each of which leverages the notion of ‘distance’ to augment insights obtained by relying on topology alone. These methods are used to answer the questions: What is the social and spatial structure of the network? Who are the key individuals at different spatial scales? We use two synthetic networks with properties mimicking the ones reported in the literature as validation datasets and a case study of employer–employee network. The methods characterize the employer–employee as spatially loose with predominantly local connections and identify key individuals responsible for keeping the network connected at different spatial scales.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1080/13658816.2019.1567736","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"related_articles_were_imported":false,"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-08-02T13:25:04.358Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"C3tPDxiBQfWqJepaMpuwxA==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6107f230b023a101bc07fd39"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"oVv/hFA5Sn6p8ZrLgQBFBg==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"Random Spatial Network Models for Core-Periphery Structure","authors":["J.

One problem NLP might help solving is geolocation inference or geolocation detection from online social networks. Detecting the location of Twitter users based on the text of their tweets is useful since not many users publicly declare their locations or geotag their tweets. Location information is crucial for a variety of applications such as event detection, disease and illness tracking and user profiling.

The position of a firm in the network exerts a curvilinear effect on its strategy of syndication in the future. Specifically, less-centered firms focus more on the quantity of information and are prone to gather information by syndication (especially with familiar partners).

Peer-to-peer systems are known to be resilient in the presence of churn and uncorrelated failures. However, their behavior in extreme scenarios, where massive correlated failures occur, is not well-studied. In this paper, we consider nodes within a relatively small geographical region of the network (2.5 percent or fewer Internet users), and study whether users can communicate with their ($n$-hop away) social neighbors in a peer-to-peer fashion after network partitions. The contribution of our work is twofold: 1) we study the effect of such partitions on topology and routing of structured and social-based unstructured P2P overlays, including a newly proposed Social-aware overlay; 2) for the overlay with better routability observed from the first step, we propose and evaluate a social-based bootstrapping method for nodes to join the overlay, under the constraints imposed by firewalls and NATs. In our analysis, we consider both real and synthetic datasets of online social networks. The results of our evaluation show that structured P2P overlay routability is severely hampered by wide-scale partition events. In addition, the proposed social-based unstructured overlay network provides improved routability while maintaining a smaller number of links. Furthermore, in the evaluation of bootstrapping, by varying several input parameters, from 90 to 97 percent of nodes in Social-aware overlay could bootstrap and reach their direct-neighbors.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1109/TNSE.2018.2871980","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"related_articles_were_imported":false,"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-08-02T13:25:06.887Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"C3tPDxiBQfWqJepaMpuwxA==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6107f233b023a101bc07fd3f"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"2IbZOcXfQseqd6AujeaS6A==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"14.

In this case study paper, we review existing research on two key approaches, namely: (1) a top-down multi-scale network science approach, and (2) a bottom-up entropy-maximization interaction network approach. Using simple socioeconomic indicators, we were able to construct a very accurate interaction model that can predict traffic volume, and the model can forward estimate the impact of population growth or fuel cost. Using network science approaches, we were able to identify community structures and relate them to economic outputs. We also saw how hubs evolved over time to become more influential. Looking into the future, using random graph theory, it seems that reduced flight cost will lead to increased hub influence.

Results indicate that, beside pure leaders and followers, some hotels adopt mixed behaviours.

Although recent literature infers that the transmission of knowledge in industrial clusters is accomplished via inherited network ties, this has not been directly measured.

A detailed picture of any diffusion process can be achieved only when both a detailed network structure and individual diffusion pathways are obtained. Studying such diffusion networks provides valuable insights to understand important actors in carrying and spreading contagions and to help predict occurrences of new infections. Most prior research focuses on modeling diffusion process only in the temporal dimension. The advent of rich social, media and geo-tagged data now allows us to study and model this diffusion process in both temporal and spatial dimensions than previously possible. Nevertheless, how information, ideas or diseases are propagated through the network as an overall spatiotemporal process is difficult to trace. This propagation is continuous over time and space, where individual transmissions occur at different rates via complex and latent connections. To tackle this challenge, a probabilistic spatiotemporal algorithm for network diffusion simulation (STAND) is developed based on the survival model in this research. Both time and geographic distance are used as explanatory variables to simulate the diffusion process over two different network structures. The aim is to provide a more detailed measure of how different contagions are transmitted through various networks where nodes denote geographic locations at a large scale.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1145/3423335.3428164","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"related_articles_were_imported":false,"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-08-02T13:25:09.136Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"C3tPDxiBQfWqJepaMpuwxA==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6107f236b023a101bc07fd44"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"6cWzBOhASNC2RwiN3HnpGQ==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"Can multiple social ties help improve human location prediction","authors":["Cong Li","Shu-Min Zhang","Xiang Li"],"date":{"$date":"2019-08-02T00:00:00.000Z"},"pdf_url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/J.PHYSA.2019.04.068","abstract":"Abstract Predicting the future locations of human is of vital importance in practical applications, such as the urban planning and epidemic controlling.

This phenomenon is rooted in the underlying complex structure and dynamics of social systems. Far from homogeneously mixing or adopting conforming views, individuals self-organize into groups at multiple scales, ranging from families up to cities and cultures. In this paper, we study the fragmented structure of American society using mobility and communication networks obtained from geo-located social media data. We find self-organized patches with clear geographical borders that are consistent between physical and virtual spaces. The patches have multi-scale structure ranging from parts of a city up to the entire nation. Their significance is reflected in distinct patterns of collective interests and conversations. Finally, we explain the patch emergence by a model of network growth that combines mechanisms of geographical distance gravity, preferential attachment and spatial growth. Our observations are consistent with the emergence of social groups whose separated association and communication reinforce distinct identities. Rather than eliminating borders, the virtual space reproduces them as people mirror their offline lives online.

Movement allows us to congregate with our peers, access things we need, and exchange information. Human mobility has huge impacts on topics like urban and transportation planning, social and biologic spreading, and economic outcomes. So far, modeling these processes has been hindered by a lack of data. This is radically changing with the rise of ubiquitous devices. In this chapter, we discuss recent progress deriving insights from the massive, high resolution data sets collected from mobile phone and other devices. We begin with individual mobility, where empirical evidence and statistical models have shown important intrinsic and universal characteristics about our movement: we, as human, are fundamentally slow to explore new places, relatively predictable, and mostly unique. We then explore methods of modeling aggregate movement of people from place to place and discuss how these estimates can be used to understand and optimize transportation infrastructure. Finally, we highlight applications of these findings to the dynamics of disease spread, social networks, and economic outcomes. J.L.

Despite growing evidence suggesting that geographic location and distance restrict online communication and interaction patterns, the role of geographic factors on the information dissemination in mobile social networks is often overlooked. We conducted a large-scale analysis on how the geographic factors influence the information dissemination in mobile social networks, by using two different datasets which recorded billions of users’ viewing and forwarding activities corresponding as well as the temporal and geographic information. The effects of two geographic factors, namely location and distance, on the probability and velocity of information dissemination were explored by measuring the geographic distribution of the four key indicators, namely viewing probability, forwarding probability, response time, and decision-making time. The results verify the distance decay effect of the information dissemination probability, and demonstrate that the velocity of information dissemination is not dependent on geographic distance.

However, in practical deployment, D2D content caching has its own problems. In particular, not all of the user devices are willing to share the content with others due to numerous concerns, such as security, battery life, and social relationship. In this paper, we consider the factor of social relationship in the deployment of D2D content caching. First, we apply stochastic geometry theory to derive an analytical expression of downloading performance for the D2D caching network. Specifically, a social relationship model with respect to the physical distance is adopted in our analysis to obtain the average download delay performance using random and deterministic caching strategies. Second, to achieve a better performance in more practical and specific scenarios, we develop a socially aware distributed caching strategy based on a decentralized learning automaton, to optimize the cache placement operation in D2D networks. Different from the existing caching schemes, the proposed algorithm not only considers the file request probability and the closeness of devices as measured by their physical distance but also takes into account the social relationship between D2D users. Our simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can converge quickly and outperforms the random and deterministic caching strategies. With these results, our work sheds insights on the design of D2D caching in the practical deployment of 5G networks.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1109/TVT.2018.2796575","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"related_articles_were_imported":false,"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-08-02T13:25:24.544Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"C3tPDxiBQfWqJepaMpuwxA==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6107f244b023a101bc07fd50"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"Ja7pDT/HTEuThvHgrm8jXQ==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"Impact of Content Popularity on Information Coverage in Online Social Networks","authors":["Riheng Jia","Tianyuan Liu","Jinbei Zhang","L.

In turn, social networks themselves are associated with geographic proximity, historical ties, political boundaries, and other factors. Traditionally, the unavailability of large-scale and representative data on social connectedness between individuals or geographic regions has posed a challenge for empirical research on social networks. More recently, a body of such research has begun to emerge using data on social connectedness from online social networking services such as Facebook, LinkedIn, and Twitter. To date, most of these research projects have been built on anonymized administrative microdata from Facebook, typically by working with coauthor teams that include Facebook employees. However, there is an inherent limit to the number of researchers that will be able to work with social network data through such collaborations. In this paper, we therefore introduce a new measure of social connectedness at the US county level. Our Social Connectedness Index is based on friendship links on Facebook, the global online social networking service. Specifically, the Social Connectedness Index corresponds to the relative frequency of Facebook friendship links between every county-pair in the United States, and between every US county and every foreign country. Given Facebook's scale as well as the relative representativeness of Facebook's user body, these data provide the first comprehensive measure of friendship networks at a national level.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1257/JEP.32.3.259","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"related_articles_were_imported":false,"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-08-02T13:25:24.842Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"C3tPDxiBQfWqJepaMpuwxA==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6107f245b023a101bc07fd52"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"Z/zJaxALQUGec/H2MgUJnA==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"Exploring the effectiveness of location-based social media in modeling user activity space: A case study of Weibo","authors":["Yihong Yuan","Xujiao Wang"],"date":{"$date":"2018-08-02T00:00:00.000Z"},"pdf_url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/tgis.12450","abstract":"Semantic Scholar extracted view of ","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1111/tgis.12450","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"related_articles_were_imported":false,"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-08-02T13:25:25.034Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"C3tPDxiBQfWqJepaMpuwxA==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6107f245b023a101bc07fd53"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"jQ/TwhKcQoapfOxUxNy2GA==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"Small World Phenomena","authors":["P.

These groups are then selected as recipients in lieu of or in addition to users. However, keeping named groups up to date is a difficult and error-prone task when conducted manually. Past schemes automating this task make different tradeoffs and can be distinguished based on several factors including the types of named groups they consider, whether they evolve a specific group or a set of multiple groups, and how integrated they are with techniques for predicting initial groups. We analyze these approaches and identify a design space of potential evolutionary approaches. Using this analysis, we introduce a novel approach for automatically suggesting a sub-type of evolution, evolutionary growth. This approach (a) requires no prior knowledge of which groups change, (b) composes, and therefore interoperates, with an existing engine for recommending named groups, and (c) extracts groups from the social graph of multiple types of applications regardless of whether the graph are explicit or derived implicitly from message communication. Our evaluation considers social graphs created using explicit and implicit connections, and identifies the conditions under which the approach outperforms baseline techniques.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1007/s10606-018-9321-5","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"related_articles_were_imported":false,"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-08-02T13:25:27.727Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"C3tPDxiBQfWqJepaMpuwxA==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6107f247b023a101bc07fd57"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"9oEAkfMyTbyqSUBUeaPxfw==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"Social-Spatiotemporal Analysis of Topical and Polarized Communities in Online Social Networks","authors":["Mauro Coletto","C.

These properties have been theoretically explained by classic models like Chung-Lu random graphs or preferential attachment graphs. However, real-world networks exhibit additional structural properties such as strong clustering that can best be described by using geometry. For instance, in social networks two people are more likely to know each other if they live in the same region and share hobbies, both of which can be encoded as spatial information. This is why the focus of the literature on random graph models for complex networks shifted towards modern, geometry-based models. In fact, in 2010, Boguñá et al. observed that the internet graph can be embedded into hyperbolic geometry [BPK10] and therefore proposed the model of hyperbolic random graphs [Kri+10]. As many desirable features of real-world networks naturally emerge in hyperbolic random graphs, they gained a lot of attention during the last years and serve as benchmarks for network algorithms like routing or link prediction. In the first part of this thesis, we propose a class of scale-free random graphs models with underlying geometry that we call geometric inhomogeneous random graphs (GIRGs). GIRGs generalize hyperbolic random graphs to higher dimensions and are technically simpler while preserving their qualitative behavior. In GIRGs, every vertex draws independently a random position in a geometric space and a positive weight according to a power law. For each pair of nodes, we insert an edge with a certain probability that is higher if the nodes have larger weights and if they are geometrically close.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.3929/ETHZ-B-000269658","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"related_articles_were_imported":false,"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-08-02T13:25:29.597Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"C3tPDxiBQfWqJepaMpuwxA==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6107f24ab023a101bc07fd5b"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"PAa6X1PXQxK91uxYRcaMHQ==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"Visual Analysis of Distributed Search Traffic in a Peer-to-peer Network","authors":["Weimao Ke"],"date":{"$date":"2018-08-02T00:00:00.000Z"},"pdf_url":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8488222","abstract":"We study distributed searches in fully decentralized peer-to-peer networks.

Given the ubiquity of this process for assembling network data, it becomes crucial to understand the role of such a core-fringe structure. \nHere we study how the inclusion of fringe nodes affects the standard task of network link prediction. One might initially think the inclusion of any additional data is useful, and hence that it should be beneficial to include all fringe nodes that are available. However, we find that this is not true; in fact, there is substantial variability in the value of the fringe nodes for prediction. In some datasets, once an algorithm is selected, including any additional data from the fringe can actually hurt prediction performance; in other datasets, including some amount of fringe information is useful before prediction performance saturates or even declines; and in further cases, including the entire fringe leads to the best performance. While such variety might seem surprising, we show that these behaviors are exhibited by simple random graph models.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1145/3308558.3313626","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"related_articles_were_imported":false,"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-08-02T13:25:30.851Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"C3tPDxiBQfWqJepaMpuwxA==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6107f24bb023a101bc07fd5d"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"C3xgphJ7SZaBYyG1pqK0Zw==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"The role and potential of social networks sites in tertiary education","authors":["D.

Methodology : Methodologically, the paper rests on an extensive, comprehensive and comparative theoretical research on the subject, as well as on primary research involving the in-depth survey of 125 university students in Northern Italy. Findings : The findings underline the importance of utilizing SNSs to improve educational communications, sharing of information, student-student and student-educator interaction, efficiency, polyphony and more. The research also stressed the need for SNS adoption to be specific and in accordance with both student and lecturer attitudes, competences and limitations, as well other therein specified stakeholders and added values.  Research limitations : this is an exploratory study based on a sample of moderately limited size and, although generically valuable, it focuses specifically on Northern Italy. Implications : the present research, in addition to its practical applications, may be extended to the academic faculty and to an analysis, based on a wider sample, of the underlying motivators that inhibit students and faculty from adopting SNSs for educational purposes.

Although social-aware routing approaches are shown to achieve superior performance, they are usually destination-agnostic since social metrics are measured without destination information. To this end, we propose a Destination-Aware Social routing scheme for MONs, namely DAS, which combines the advantages of destination-aware betweenness centrality and spread of epidemic disease. When forwarding, DAS utilizes a destination-aware social metric to make routing decision. Only a small number of replicas for a message are disseminated based on susceptible/infective (SI) model to ensure that the overhead is small and controlled. We conduct extensive simulations using real trace data sets to show improved performance with low overhead compared to existing social-aware routing approaches in various scenarios.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1109/HPCC/SmartCity/DSS.2018.00094","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"related_articles_were_imported":false,"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-08-02T13:25:31.304Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"C3tPDxiBQfWqJepaMpuwxA==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6107f24cb023a101bc07fd5f"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"P9lVl754QjCae1hVzQOF5Q==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"Using Information in Access Logs for Large Scale Identity Linkage","authors":["Leila Jalali","Sungchul Kim","Narayanan Krishnamoorthy","Rahul Biswas"],"date":{"$date":"2018-08-02T00:00:00.000Z"},"pdf_url":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8622460","abstract":"With the world becoming more connected than ever and the growth of the number of connected devices, each individual user accesses services from a range of devices, including personal desktops and laptop computers, tablets, mobile devices, vehicles, and entertainment systems. One fundamental problem is to identify the user using the fragmentation of identity and consumer profiles across these connected devices. In this paper, we discuss Adobe’s Identity Graph that provides a comprehensive solution to the challenge posed by fragmentation of identities. In particular, we propose an approach to use all the features in the logs using both online data traffic and offline data logs. We use probability based correlation methods to link identities across different devices with high accuracy. We validate the effectiveness of our proposed approach with massive large data covering more than 1.9 billion connected devices resulting in more than 200 million user identities. Our evaluation results show that using information in access logs can be effective in linking identities and achieving a practical and scalable solution.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1109/BigData.2018.8622460","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"related_articles_were_imported":false,"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-08-02T13:25:32.237Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"C3tPDxiBQfWqJepaMpuwxA==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6107f24db023a101bc07fd60"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"iey7ryJdRRG5mcYEZ7vRYg==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"Online Social Networks (OSN) Evolution Model Based on Homophily and Preferential Attachment","authors":["Jebran Khan","Sungchang Lee"],"date":{"$date":"2018-08-02T00:00:00.000Z"},"pdf_url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/sym10110654","abstract":"Semantic Scholar extracted view of ","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.3390/sym10110654","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"related_articles_were_imported":false,"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-08-02T13:25:33.109Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"C3tPDxiBQfWqJepaMpuwxA==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6107f24db023a101bc07fd61"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"tFjcwyCnSPigXTmUcSfxQA==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"The Settlement Structure Is Reflected in Personal Investments: Distance-Dependent Network Modularity-Based Measurement of Regional Attractiveness","authors":["László Gadár","Z.

Based on the calculation of the internal and external linking probabilities, we propose several measures to evaluate the attractiveness of towns and geographic regions. Community detection based on several null models indicates that modules of the network coincide with administrative regions, in which Budapest is the absolute centre, and where county centres function as hubs.

By associating these posts with US Census tracts through their locations, we linked socioeconomic indicators to group-level signals extracted from social media, including emotions, language, and online social ties. Our analysis shows that tracts with higher education levels have weaker social ties, but this effect is attenuated for tracts with high ratio of Hispanic residents. Negative emotions are associated with more frequent online interactions, or stronger social ties, while positive emotions are associated with weaker ties. These results hold for both Spanish and English tweets, evidencing that language does not affect this relationship between emotion and social ties.

This article contributes a new empirical study to the debate of “death of distance” by considering the effect of spatial autocorrelation in the estimation of distance decay effect with the incorporation of network autocorrelation in spatial econometric modeling. This work is based on a city-level dataset from China's largest social networking site called Weibo. The findings are shown as following. First, the coefficient value of network autocorrelation term (0.007, significant at 0.01 level) suggests that the city-level online social links are spatially dependent. In other words, these social connections are not randomly distributed across space but tend to form spatial clusters where neighboring links are more similar. Second, controlling spatial autocorrelation in the data, a distance decay effect on the formation of online social links is unveiled with a much smaller scaling exponent of the distances (i.e., 0.276) as compared to those (e.g., 2.0, 1.8, 1.45, 1.06, 1.03, 0.4, and 0.5) in existing studies. This research provides a useful modeling framework to analyze the real-world driving forces that characterize the patterns of social interactions in virtual space and thus advance our understanding in the connection of virtual and real spaces.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1016/j.compenvurbsys.2018.02.001","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"related_articles_were_imported":false,"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-08-02T13:25:36.784Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"C3tPDxiBQfWqJepaMpuwxA==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6107f250b023a101bc07fd67"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"d7TVSo8NTgqrbYWLDrT3Qw==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"An enhanced communication mechanism for partitioned social overlay networks using modified multi-dimensional routing","authors":["Ahsan Hussain","B.

We investigate the role of social ties in the pairing of concurring auditor (reviewer) and lead auditor (reviewee). We find that the presence of social ties between the concurring auditor and the lead auditor resulting from local affinity, i.e., having the same dialect and working in the same office, makes it more likely for the auditors to form pairs. In contrast, the presence of educational affinity, i.e., having a similar level of audit experience and the same field of study, makes it less likely for auditors to form pairs. Using an instrumental variable approach to control for selection effects, we find that pairs sharing a local background provide lower audit quality, whereas pairs sharing an educational background provide higher audit quality.

We measure the encounters in space and time and establish a link between walkers after they coincide several times. This generates a temporal network that is characterized by global quantities. We compare this dynamics with real data for two cities: New York City and Tokyo.

Our measure, which we call the “Social Connectedness Index�? (SCI), is based on the number of friendship links on Facebook, the world’s largest online social networking service. Within the U.S., social connectedness is strongly decreasing in geographic distance between counties: for the population of the average county, 62.8% of friends live within 100 miles. The populations of counties with more geographically dispersed social networks are generally richer, more educated, and have a higher life expectancy. Region-pairs that are more socially connected have higher trade flows, even after controlling for geographic distance and the similarity of regions along other economic and demographic measures. Higher social connectedness is also associated with more cross-county migration and patent citations. Social connectedness between U.S. counties and foreign countries is correlated with past migration patterns, with social connectedness decaying in the time since the primary migration wave from that country.

Abstract This study proposes a framework to investigate the roles of urban spaces in connecting social contacts (i.e., “friends”). The framework is applied to a Call Detail Record (CDR) dataset collected in Singapore. First, a comparative analysis is performed to understand how friends share urban space differently from random people. Then, we derive two metrics to quantify the “bonding” and “bridging” capabilities of places in the city. The two metrics reflect the potential of a place in connecting friends and random people (e.g., chance encounters), respectively. Finally, we examine the temporal signature of the places’ bonding capabilities, and associate the results with various types of Points of Interest (POIs). We find that: (1) friends are more likely to share urban space than random people, and they also share more locations; (2) a place could play different roles in connecting friends vs. random people, and the relationship (between bonding and bridging) varies depending on the time and type of a day (weekdays vs. weekends); (3) the temporal signature of bonding capability is strongly related to the semantics of a place; (4) certain POI types (e.g., shopping malls) tend to have a much higher impact on bonding capability than others (e.g., sports centers).","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1111/tgis.12285","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"related_articles_were_imported":false,"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-08-02T13:25:48.057Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"C3tPDxiBQfWqJepaMpuwxA==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6107f25cb023a101bc07fd71"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"DI0qNGt6Qpu3YGbjr/EvGg==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"Probabilistic Visitor Stitching on Cross-Device Web Logs","authors":["Sungchul Kim","Nikhil Kini","Jay Pujara","Eunyee Koh","L.

However the variety of devices, including mobile phones, appliances, and smart watches, from which users access web services from both anonymous and logged-in sessions poses a significant obstacle to user identification. The resulting entity resolution task of establishing user identity across devices and sessions is commonly referred to as ``visitor stitching.'' We introduce a general, probabilistic approach to visitor stitching using features and attributes commonly contained in web logs. Using web logs from two real-world corporate websites, we motivate the need for probabilistic models by quantifying the difficulties posed by noise, ambiguity, and missing information in deployment. Next, we introduce our approach using probabilistic soft logic (PSL), a statistical relational learning framework capable of capturing similarities across many sessions and enforcing transitivity. We present a detailed description of model features and design choices relevant to the visitor stitching problem. Finally, we evaluate our PSL model on binary classification performance for two real-world visitor stitching datasets. Our model demonstrates significantly better performance than several state-of-the-art classifiers, and we show how this advantage results from collective reasoning across sessions.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1145/3038912.3052711","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"related_articles_were_imported":false,"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-08-02T13:25:48.274Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"C3tPDxiBQfWqJepaMpuwxA==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6107f25db023a101bc07fd72"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"tGKRQwQwS+iU4exeoC+paw==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"The Social Dynamics of Collective Action: Evidence from the Captain Swing Riots, 1830-31","authors":["Toke S.

We define a fundamental quantity for each user, i.e., the so-called neighborhood cardinality, to measure how many and how often other MSN users visit his nearby area with a given range. The core of NCBM is a principle: The probability that a user, say u, is followed by another user, say v, obeys a power law distribution of the neighborhood cardinality of user u.

To model the multicast group in wireless social networks, we should incorporate two important social characteristics, i.e., social relationship and group size. In most existing works, the modeling of social relationship only considers geographic factor. However, such models fail to well characterize wireless social networks, since unlike that in traditional wireless networks, geographic distance is no longer the major factor that affects people’s communications and some non-geographic factors, such as user popularity, become more and more important. Moreover, group size is always assumed to be known a priori in previous works, which cannot fully meet the realistic condition. Therefore, in this paper, we model the multicast group from a combination of geographic and non-geographic (GN) perspectives. Specifically, we propose the GN Model to characterize social relationship and the independently-selected model to characterize group size. In addition to the geographic distance considered in the modeling of social relationship, we also introduce user popularity which reflects the influence of each user on others. Then, we assume that the source transmits the data packet to all his friends following the multicast manner. Based on the proposed model, we calculate transmission distance and network traffic load, and then discuss how they are influenced by both geographic and GN factors. Moreover, our proposed models are verified through experimental measurements based on real datasets.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1109/TWC.2017.2691317","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"related_articles_were_imported":false,"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-08-02T13:25:52.727Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"C3tPDxiBQfWqJepaMpuwxA==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6107f260b023a101bc07fd79"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"a3j12u5AS7W0ocNCpeZBDQ==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"A Fair Resource Allocation Algorithm for Cooperative Multicast Aided Content Distribution","authors":["Jie Hu","Yizhe Zhao","Kun Yang","Lie-liang Yang"],"date":{"$date":"2017-08-02T00:00:00.000Z"},"pdf_url":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8255072","abstract":"Activating direct communications among mobile users (MUs) for sharing a content of common interest (CoCI) becomes an essential paradigm for realising the efficient content distribution in densely populated scenarios.

How and to what extent will the information on social media achieve widespread diffusion across the world? How can we quantify the interaction between users from different geolocations in the diffusion process? How will the spatial patterns of information diffusion change over time? To address these questions, a dynamic social gravity model (SGM) is proposed to quantify the dynamic spatial interaction behavior among social media users in information diffusion. The dynamic SGM includes three factors that are theoretically significant to the spatial diffusion of information: geographic distance, cultural proximity, and linguistic similarity. Temporal dimension is also taken into account to help detect recency effect, and ground-truth data is integrated into the model to help measure the diffusion power. Furthermore, SocialWave, a visual analytic system, is developed to support both spatial and temporal investigative tasks. SocialWave provides a temporal visualization that allows users to quickly identify the overall temporal diffusion patterns, which reflect the spatial characteristics of the diffusion network. When a meaningful temporal pattern is identified, SocialWave utilizes a new occlusion-free spatial visualization, which integrates a node-link diagram into a circular cartogram for further analysis. Moreover, we propose a set of rich user interactions that enable in-depth, multi-faceted analysis of the diffusion on social media.

In a system without any central control, the rate of interaction may depend simply on how the individuals move around. But interactions could in turn influence movement; individuals might seek out interactions, or their movement in response to interaction could influence further interaction rates. We develop a general framework to address these questions, using collision theory to establish a baseline expected rate of interaction based on proximity. We test the models using data from harvester ant colonies. A colony uses feedback from interactions inside the nest to regulate foraging activity. Potential foragers leave the nest in response to interactions with returning foragers with food. The time series of interactions and local density of ants show how density hotspots lead to interactions that are clustered in time.

This work studies, from a theoretical perspective, whether the additional detour costs of limiting shared rides to social network contacts would be prohibitive. It proposes a social network based ridesharing algorithm with heterogeneous detour tolerances for varied social contacts. The theoretical matching rates and detour costs are compared in a simulation for three levels of social connectivity: travelling with direct contacts only, with direct and indirect contacts, or with anyone. The simulation allows for a systematic and comprehensive testing of system behaviour when varying the parameters of social network structure, detour tolerance, and spatial distribution of friendship. Results show that for a clustered friendship – the expected spatial distribution of a social network growing with a ridesharing network – ridesharing with friends does not cause significantly higher costs.

Remarkably, although there were no displacements of rioters, the riot activity did travel. Access to daily national police data has allowed us to explore the dynamics of riot propagation. Here we show that an epidemic-like model, with just a few parameters and a single sociological variable characterizing neighbourhood deprivation, accounts quantitatively for the full spatio-temporal dynamics of the riots. This is the first time that such data-driven modelling involving contagion both within and between cities (through geographic proximity or media) at the scale of a country, and on a daily basis, is performed. Moreover, we give a precise mathematical characterization to the expression “wave of riots”, and provide a visualization of the propagation around Paris, exhibiting the wave in a way not described before. The remarkable agreement between model and data demonstrates that geographic proximity played a major role in the propagation, even though information was readily available everywhere through media. Finally, we argue that our approach gives a general framework for the modelling of the dynamics of spontaneous collective uprisings.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1038/s41598-017-18093-4","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"related_articles_were_imported":false,"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-08-02T13:26:04.251Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"C3tPDxiBQfWqJepaMpuwxA==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6107f26cb023a101bc07fd89"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"3sfG4WVRTc2AkGuM4CRklg==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"A survey on topological properties, network models and analytical measures in detecting influential nodes in online social networks","authors":["Ebin Deni Raj","L.

In the era of big data now we have the chance to give more insights on the geography of the internet-related social processes, since there are unprecedentedly large enough samples to analyse social behaviour as well as to understand the changing role of geography. Accordingly, the following paper is focusing on the geographical analysis of a nowadays very popular topic: the online social networks. Examples of iWiW, the largest Hungarian social media site, are applied to show that such networks are evolving and are structured not independently of spatial constraints. The paper attempts to present many proximity-driven characteristics of this network starting from distance-based examples of space-time evolution and with examples of proximity-focused statistical analysis of the spatial structure. The calculations highlighted that—although it was changing in time—proximity-driven processes have been predominant in city-to-city diffusion, especially when dealing with intracity spreading, but also at cases of short distance neighbourhood diffusion. Calculations by comparing factors like the average strength of connectivity, population size and average relative distance rates of cities also confirmed that proximity had an influence on the network structure.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1007/978-3-319-45123-7_15","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"related_articles_were_imported":false,"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-08-02T13:26:04.255Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"C3tPDxiBQfWqJepaMpuwxA==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6107f272b023a101bc07fd8b"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"jbpJ43oLSv6YIgvamC3wbg==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"Energy-Efficient Cross-Layer Design of Wireless Mesh Networks for Content Sharing in Online Social Networks","authors":["Jie Hu","Lie-liang Yang","L.

A power control aided WMN is proposed for energy-efficient content sharing. Based on our power control scheme in the physical layer, an interference-constrained-channel-reuse scheme and a Dijkstra algorithm aided energy-efficient routing protocol are invoked for the medium access control layer and for the network layer, respectively. Inspired by the tool of social network analysis, both the singular and composite betweenness metrics are invoked for quantifying the duty-cycle of mesh routers. The former only considers the topology of the mesh backbone, while the latter considers the topologies of both the OSN and the WMN. Furthermore, the singular/composite betweenness is exploited for designing sophisticated caching strategies in order to improve the content sharing performance. We demonstrate that our caching strategies are capable of reducing the total energy dissipation by as much as  ${\\text{40}}\\%$. Specifically, the composite betweenness based caching strategy is capable of reducing the energy dissipation of the mesh clients by  ${\\text{358}}\\%$, compared to its singular betweenness based counterpart.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1109/TVT.2017.2678167","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"related_articles_were_imported":false,"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-08-02T13:26:10.383Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"C3tPDxiBQfWqJepaMpuwxA==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6107f272b023a101bc07fd8c"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"inEyQ31YRS2lE3xNLQI3pg==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"Greedy Routing and the Algorithmic Small-World Phenomenon","authors":["K.

However, from today's perspective his model has several severe shortcomings that limit the applicability to real-world networks. In order to give a more convincing explanation of the algorithmic small-world phenomenon, we study decentralized greedy routing in a more flexible random graph model (geometric inhomogeneous random graphs) which overcomes all previous shortcomings. Apart from exhibiting good properties in theory, it has also been extensively experimentally validated that this model reasonably captures real-world networks. In this model, the greedy routing protocol is purely distributed as each vertex only needs to know information about its direct neighbors. We prove that it succeeds with constant probability, and in case of success almost surely finds an almost shortest path of length Θ(log log n), where our bound is tight including the leading constant. Moreover, we study natural local patching methods which augment greedy routing by backtracking and which do not require any global knowledge. We show that such methods can ensure success probability 1 in an asymptotically tight number of steps. These results also address the question of Krioukov et al. whether there are efficient local routing protocols for the internet graph. There were promising experimental studies, but the question remained unsolved theoretically. Our results give for the first time a rigorous and analytical affirmative answer.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1145/3087801.3087829","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"related_articles_were_imported":false,"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-08-02T13:26:10.605Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"C3tPDxiBQfWqJepaMpuwxA==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6107f273b023a101bc07fd8d"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"kgRhn8TRTuKQzolwhw2YqQ==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"Link-prediction to tackle the boundary specification problem in social network surveys","authors":["Tobias Jordan","Oto Costa Pinho Alves","P.

We consider two distributions of legitimate nodes: They are homogeneously placed based on a Poisson point process (PPP), or they are inhomogeneously distributed as multiclustering topology. In particular, we consider two scenarios: 1) the noncolluding case, where each eavesdropper decodes its receiving message independently; and 2) the colluding case, where eavesdroppers can cooperate to decode the message. We adopt a rank-based model to describe the social characteristic and investigate its impact on the secrecy capacity using the technique of self-interference cancelation. We employ a passive attack model, where eavesdroppers can only listen to transmissions among legitimate nodes. Our important findings include the following: 1) In the noncolluding case, secrecy capacity is not influenced by eavesdroppers in order sense, but it varies with the density of eavesdroppers and social impacts in the colluding case. 2) The proposed scheme can achieve optimal secrecy throughput neglecting polylogarithmic factor in homogeneous wireless networks.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1109/TVT.2016.2582778","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"related_articles_were_imported":false,"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-08-02T13:26:11.232Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"C3tPDxiBQfWqJepaMpuwxA==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6107f273b023a101bc07fd8f"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"zciuSqJkS7Wg9N1FkMC9JA==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"Social-Distance based anycast routing in Delay Tolerant Networks","authors":["Tuan Le","M.

Anycast is an important group communication paradigm for numerous DTN applications such as resource discovery and information exchange in emergency or crisis situations. While anycasting has been studied extensively in the context of the Internet and Mobile Ad-Hoc Networks (MANETs), efficient anycasting in DTNs is a significantly different and challenging problem due to frequent partitions and intermittent connectivity among nodes. In this paper, we propose a single-copy anycast routing strategy in which the current carrier forwards the message to an encounter node with a higher Anycast Social Distance Metric (ASDM). We formulate ASDM based on the multi-hop social distances to anycast group members. ASDM balances the trade-off between a short path to the closest, single group member and a longer path to the area where many other group members reside. That is, it optimizes both the efficiency and robustness of message delivery. We derive the social distances from the multi-hop delivery probabilities over the most probable path in the social contact graph. Through extensive simulation studies using a real-world mobility trace, we show that our scheme achieves a high delivery ratio, low delay, and low transmission cost compared to other anycast strategies.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1109/MedHocNet.2016.7528495","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"related_articles_were_imported":false,"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-08-02T13:26:11.360Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"C3tPDxiBQfWqJepaMpuwxA==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6107f275b023a101bc07fd90"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"vVdfuYNqStKEG20Gx91zdQ==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"When Can Government Venture Capital Funds Bridge the Equity Gap?","authors":["Yan Alperovych","A.

In this paper, we propose a data analytical workflow for exploring Call Detail Records in conjunction with geotagged tweets. The aim was to investigate how massive data point observations can be analyzed to detect spatial outliers in collective mobility patterns that are coupled with social ties. This workflow consists of analytical tasks that are developed based on the a-priori assumption of two isometric spaces where Natural Language Processing techniques are used to find spatial clusters from geotagged tweets in a Social Space which are later used to aggregate the Call Detail Records generated by antennas located in the Mobility Space. The dynamic weighted centroids that are given by the mean location of the number of calls per hour of all antennas that belong to a particular cluster are used to compute Standard Deviation Ellipses. The longer the period of time a weighted centroid stays outside of the 99.7% probability region of an ellipse, the highest the likelihood that they are spatial outliers. The workflow was implemented for the city of Dakar in Senegal. The results indicate that the further the hourly weighted centroids are skewed from the normal mean of an ellipse, the stronger the influence of a cluster is in finding spatial outliers. Furthermore, the longer the period of time the outliers stays outside of the 99.7% probability region of an ellipse, the highest the likelihood that the outliers are genuine and can be associated to extraordinary events such as natural disasters and national holidays.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1080/13658816.2016.1144887","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"related_articles_were_imported":false,"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-08-02T13:26:15.327Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"C3tPDxiBQfWqJepaMpuwxA==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6107f277b023a101bc07fd94"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"KrAA8xQvSD+78EfqUhSjVA==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"GIScience Considerations in Spatial Social Networks","authors":["D.

These spatial dependencies, best described as power laws, play a consequential role in broad areas ranging from how an epidemic spreads to diffusion of ideas and information. Here we established the first formal link, to our knowledge, between mobility and communication patterns by deriving a scaling relationship connecting them. The uncovered scaling theory not only allows us to derive human movements from communication volumes, or vice versa, but it also documents a new degree of regularity that helps deepen our quantitative understanding of human behavior. Massive datasets that capture human movements and social interactions have catalyzed rapid advances in our quantitative understanding of human behavior during the past years. One important aspect affecting both areas is the critical role space plays. Indeed, growing evidence suggests both our movements and communication patterns are associated with spatial costs that follow reproducible scaling laws, each characterized by its specific critical exponents. Although human mobility and social networks develop concomitantly as two prolific yet largely separated fields, we lack any known relationships between the critical exponents explored by them, despite the fact that they often study the same datasets. Here, by exploiting three different mobile phone datasets that capture simultaneously these two aspects, we discovered a new scaling relationship, mediated by a universal flux distribution, which links the critical exponents characterizing the spatial dependencies in human mobility and social networks. Therefore, the widely studied scaling laws uncovered in these two areas are not independent but connected through a deeper underlying reality.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1073/pnas.1525443113","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"related_articles_were_imported":false,"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-08-02T13:26:17.887Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"C3tPDxiBQfWqJepaMpuwxA==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6107f27ab023a101bc07fd99"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"EN831VP3Tm64+Wb+1LXB9w==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"Community detection in networks: A user guide","authors":["S.

If SNs, and thus, interpersonal relationships, could be analyzed in a geographic information system (GIS) setting, we could better model how humans socialize, share information, and form social groups within the complex geographic landscape. Our goal is to facilitate a guide for analyzing SNs (as derived from online social media, telecommunications, surveys, etc.) within geographic space by combining the mature fields of social network analysis (SNA) and GISystems. First, we describe why modeling socialization in geographic space is essential for understanding human behavior. We then outline best practices and techniques for embedding SN nodes and edges in GISystems by introducing terms like ‘social flow’ and ‘anthrospace’, and categorizations for data and spatial aggregation types. Finally, we explore case study vignettes of SNA within GISystems from diverse regions located in Bolivia, China, Côte d’Ivoire, Singapore, the United Kingdom, and the United States, using concepts such as geolocated dyads, ego–alter relationships, node feature roles, modularity, and network transitivity.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1080/13658816.2016.1153103","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"related_articles_were_imported":false,"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-08-02T13:26:20.352Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"C3tPDxiBQfWqJepaMpuwxA==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6107f27fb023a101bc07fd9d"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"wjjhPyxJRsCQoiZusjSbrw==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"Dynamical properties of neuronal systems with complex network structure","authors":["C.

We approach this problem by modeling the spiking activity of large-scale neuronal networks that exhibit several complex network properties. Our main focus lies on the relevance of two particular attributes for the dynamics, namely structural heterogeneity and degree correlations. Although these are fundamental properties of many brain networks, their influence on the system’s activity is not yet well understood. As a central result, we introduce a novel mean-field method that makes it possible to calculate the average activity of heterogeneous, degree-correlated neuronal networks without having to simulate each neuron explicitly. The method is based on grouping neurons with equal number of inputs (their in-degree) into populations and describing the dynamics of these populations in terms of reduced firing rate equations. We find that the connectivity structure is sufficiently captured by a reduced matrix that contains only the coupling between the populations. This matrix can be calculated analytically for some generic random networks, which allows for an efficient analysis of the system’s dynamics. With the mean-field method and numerical simulations we demonstrate that assortative degree correlations enhance the network’s ability to sustain activity for low external excitation, thus making it more sensitive to small input signals. This effect is reminiscent of an increased structural robustness of assortative networks that is well-known in network sciences. Therefore, we additionally examine the structural robustness of correlated networks with a simplified percolation model, additionally taking into account the fact that neuronal networks among other real-world systems are subject to metric constraints: Spatially close neurons are usually more likely to connect to each other than distant neurons. The main result of this examination is that for weak metric constraints assortativity generally makes the network more robust, whereas for strong metric constraints assortativity can strengthen or weaken the network, depending on its local structure. Therefore, we conclude that degree correlations and metric constraints strongly interplay and that they should not be regarded as independent features of real-world networks.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.18452/17470","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"related_articles_were_imported":false,"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-08-02T13:26:23.879Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"C3tPDxiBQfWqJepaMpuwxA==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6107f280b023a101bc07fd9e"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"DXeoCdFRQPavGWJbx11R8Q==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"On models of ‘having friends’ and SN friends distribution: Information propagation on social networks and disaster modeling","authors":["H.

This paper describes the development and operation of an agent based model (ABM) for subscriber behavior in a dynamically priced mobile telephony network. The design of the ABM was based on an analysis of real call detail records recorded in a Uganda mobile telephony network in which dynamic pricing was deployed. The ABM includes components which simulate subscriber calling behavior, mobility within the network and social linkages. Using this model, this paper reports on an investigation of a number of alternative strategies for the dynamic pricing algorithm which indicate that the network operator will likely experience revenue losses ranging from a 5 %, when the pricing algorithm is based on offering high value subscriber cohort enhanced random discounts compared to a lower value subscriber cohort, to 30 %, when the priding algorithm results in the discount on offer in a cell being inversely proportional to the contemporary cell load. Additionally, the model appears to suggest that the use of optimization algorithms to control the level of discount offered in cells would likely result in discount simply converging to a “no-discount” scenario. Finally, commentary is offered on additional factors which need to be considered when interpreting the results of this work such as the impact of subscriber churn on the size of the subscriber base and the technical and marketing challenges of deploying the various dynamic pricing algorithms which have been investigated.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1007/s11235-015-0106-6","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"related_articles_were_imported":false,"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-08-02T13:26:24.131Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"C3tPDxiBQfWqJepaMpuwxA==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6107f280b023a101bc07fda1"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"hlRNhmWBT52RWyksLu9BOA==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"Co-invention networks and inventive productivity in US cities","authors":["Stefano Breschi","C.

Internal social proximity allows knowledge to circulate quickly across a larger pool of sources; dense cliques promote trust, cooperation, and a more effective use of the acquired knowledge. Moreover, social proximity between a city's inventors and inventors outside the city contributes to enriching and renewing a city's knowledge base by facilitating faster access to fresh external knowledge.

In their efforts to call attention to environmental problems, communicate with like-minded groups, and mobilize support for their activities, radical environmental organizations also produce an enormous amount of text, which can be used to estimate the complex communications and task-based networks that underlie these organizations. Moreover, the tactics employed to garnish attention for these groups’ agenda can range from peaceful activities such as information dissemination to violent activities such as fire-bombing buildings. To obtain these varied objectives, radical environmental organizations must harness their networks, which have an important spatial component that structures their ability to communicate, coordinate and act on any given agenda item. Here, we analyze a network built from communications and information provided by the semi-annual “Do or Die” (DoD) magazine published in the UK over a 10 year period in the late 1990s and early 2000s. We first employ structural topic model methods to discover violent and nonviolent actors within the larger environmental community. Using this designation, we then compare the spatial structure of these groups, finding that violent groups are especially likely to engage in coordination and/or communication if they are sufficiently close, but exhibit a quickly decreasing probability of interaction over even a few kilometers. Further, violent and nonviolent groups each have a higher probability of coordination with their own group than across groups over even short distances. In these respects, we see that violent groups are especially local in their organization and that their geographic reach is likely very limited. This suggests that nonviolent environmental groups seek each other out over both large and short distances for communication and coordination, but violent groups tend to be highly localized.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1371/journal.pone.0166609","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"related_articles_were_imported":false,"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-08-02T13:26:28.522Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"C3tPDxiBQfWqJepaMpuwxA==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6107f284b023a101bc07fda6"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"qLbqOljfRB+htHNqg8PPzg==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"Towards next-generation routing protocols for pocket switched networks","authors":["Tekenate E.

Interest in PSNs is driven by the increasing number of handheld devices, the several wireless interfaces they possess, as well as their ability to store, carry and forward data. The lack of fixed network topology distinguishes PSNs from traditional networks, and unlike other types of mobile networks, nodes in PSNs closely follow human movement patterns. As a result, PSNs are faced with new challenges especially in the aspect of routing. Although various routing protocols have been proposed, most of them focus on optimizing the performance of networking primitives for traditional networks such as unicast, broadcast and multicast. However, these primitives themselves appear to be insufficient due to new application opportunities presented by PSNs. This paper adopts a user scenario based approach to determine the current state of PSN routing protocols. Specifically, four modes of data transfer are established from six generalized PSN user scenarios. Due to the wide range of existing routing proposals, a new taxonomy is proposed to facilitate analysis of their compatibility with the established modes of data transfer.

Finally, the capacity of social networks is compared to the traditional multicast ad hoc networks, which indicates that the capacity scaling performs better in social networks than traditional ones.

Its main themes and objectives lie in the desire to observe and understand the radical transformation of the definitions, boundaries and configurations of what we call public and private spaces, in different cultures and communities, in the age of communication, information and knowledge, and to use these understandings to formulate a set of working hypotheses for the positive, constructive, active and participatory usage of these transformed scenarios, contributing to the re-definition of concepts such as citizenship, city-governance, urban planning, civic decision-making, and more. And using, in the process, techniques such as Urban Acupuncture, Actor-Network Theory, Diasporic analysis, Peer-to-peer Urbanism and more.

An important open question is whether gossip can be realized by a distributed protocol that can do significantly better than an easily achievable bound of \\(O(n^2)\\) rounds.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1007/978-3-662-53426-7_29","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"related_articles_were_imported":false,"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-08-02T13:26:34.955Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"C3tPDxiBQfWqJepaMpuwxA==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6107f28bb023a101bc07fdad"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"fKvZZr4mTbuIOo3gJ8DOZQ==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"Tracing and Predicting Collaboration for Junior Scholars","authors":["Chun-Hua Tsai","Y.

We assume that this representation is a combination of the physical and social geography of the target environment, and the mental and physical cost of following a seemingly random pattern of attacks. Focusing on the distance and time between attacks and taking into consideration the transaction costs that state boundaries impose, we wish to understand what constrains a group leader to attack at a location other than the one that would yield the greatest overt payoff. We leverage functional data from the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data project (ACLED) dataset that catalogs violent extremist incidents in North and West Africa since 1997 to generate a network whose nodes are administrative regions. These nodes are connected by edges of qualitatively different types: undirected edges representing geographic distance, undirected edges incorporating the costs of crossing borders, and directed edges representing consecutive attacks by the same group. We analyze the resulting network using spectral embedding techniques that are able to account fully for the different types of edges. The result is a representation of North and West Africa that depicts its empirical permeability to violence. A better understanding of how location, time, and borders condition attacks enables planning, prepositioning, and response.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1080/09546553.2019.1598388","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"related_articles_were_imported":false,"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-08-02T13:26:37.246Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"C3tPDxiBQfWqJepaMpuwxA==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6107f28db023a101bc07fdaf"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"CaZgj1gBStWbcalFrKIOLw==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"Scalability analysis of distributed search in large peer-to-peer networks","authors":["Weimao Ke","J.

These devices often suffer from the lack of power and bandwidth. Hence, we have to optimize their message routing for the sake of maximizing their capabilities. However, the optimal routing typically relies on a delicate balance of diverse and often conflicting objectives, such as the route’s delay and power consumption. The network design also has to consider the nodes’ user-centric social behavior. Hence, the employment of socially aware load balancing becomes imperative for avoiding the potential formation of bottlenecks in the network’s packet-flow. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm, referred to as the multi-objective decomposition quantum optimization (MODQO) algorithm, which exploits the quantum parallelism to its full potential by reducing the database correlations for performing multi-objective routing optimization, while at the same time balancing the teletraffic load among the nodes without imposing a substantial degradation on the network’s delay and power consumption. Furthermore, we introduce a novel socially aware load balancing metric, namely, the normalized entropy of the normalized composite betweenness of the associated socially aware network, for striking a better tradeoff between the network’s delay and power consumption. We analytically prove that the MODQO algorithm achieves the full-search based accuracy at a significantly reduced complexity, which is several orders of magnitude lower than that of the full search. Finally, we compare the MODQO algorithm to the classic non-dominated sort genetic algorithm II evolutionary algorithm and demonstrate that the MODQO succeeds in halving the network’s average delay, while simultaneously reducing the network’s average power consumption by 6 dB without increasing the computational complexity.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2016.2629671","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"related_articles_were_imported":false,"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-08-02T13:26:42.290Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"C3tPDxiBQfWqJepaMpuwxA==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6107f292b023a101bc07fdb4"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"zsPYOwy0TseUldFVekM64w==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"Smallworld routing for tactical networks","authors":["P.

This calls for routing protocols that can quickly and efficiently route the application traffic to their destinations. This paper proposes a distance-based routing protocol, named as Smallworld, which finds efficient routes to target nodes often through a very short chain of intermediate nodes, without using any routing table like other standard routing protocols. This protocol exploits the “small-world” phenomenon of social networks where source-destination pairs typically get connected through few intermediate friends and the individuals can collectively discover such short paths. The key idea behind this routing protocol is that for forwarding an incoming packet to the destination, a node picks the next hop from between a one-hop neighbor, from its one-hop neighborhood that is closest to the destination, and a randomly selected long-distance neighbor, i.e., from outside of its one-hop neighborhood, based on which of these two neighbors is closer to the destination. This simple but effective algorithm can meet mission performance objectives by reducing packet losses, end-to-end delays, hop-counts, connectivity drops and control overheads in many tactical scenarios of interest.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1109/MILCOM.2016.7795430","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"related_articles_were_imported":false,"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-08-02T13:26:42.370Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"C3tPDxiBQfWqJepaMpuwxA==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6107f292b023a101bc07fdb5"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"/QALWOMtQEOy7cBK2m9dgQ==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"Developments and Challenges in Location Mining","authors":["B.

However, these methods fail to detect a simple class of sybil attacks which have been identified in online systems. Indeed, conductance-based methods seem inherently unable to do so, as they are based on the assumption that creating many edges to honest nodes is difficult, which seems to fail in real-world settings.

Geographical factors have long been known as drivers of many aspects of people’s social networks. But whether and how space and place affect social networks differently are still unclear. The widespread use of location-aware devices provides a novel source for distinguishing the mechanisms of their impacts on social networks. Using mobile phone data, this paper explores the effects of space and place on social networks. From the perspective of space, we confirm the distance decay effect in social networks, based on a comparison between synthetic social ties generated by a null model and actual social ties derived from real-world data. From the perspective of place, we introduce several measures to evaluate interactions between individuals and inspect the trio relationship including distance, spatio-temporal co-occurrence, and social ties. We found that people’s interaction is a more important factor than spatial proximity, indicating that the spatial factor has a stronger impact on social networks in place compared to that in space. Furthermore, we verify the hypothesis that interactions play an important role in strengthening friendships.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1007/s10109-016-0236-8","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"related_articles_were_imported":false,"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-08-02T13:26:44.294Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"C3tPDxiBQfWqJepaMpuwxA==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6107f295b023a101bc07fdb9"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"TpglZXvhTtaWE357Of04HA==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"The geography of the iWiW","authors":["B.

In this paper, we study the impact of differential behavior of users on performance in typical social network-enabled routing applications. We classify users into either collaborative or rational (probabilistically collaborative) and study the impact of this classification and the associated behavior of users on the performance of such applications, including random walk-based routing, shortest path based routing, breadth-first-search based routing, and Dijkstra routing. By experimenting with real-world social network traces, we make several interesting observations. First, we show that some of the existing social graphs have high routing costs, demonstrating poor structure that prevents their use in such applications. Second, we study the factors that make probabilistically collaborative nodes important for the performance of the routing protocol within the entire network and demonstrate that the importance of these nodes stems from their topological features rather than their percentage of all the nodes within the network.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.3837/tiis.2016.04.010","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"related_articles_were_imported":false,"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-08-02T13:26:45.978Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"C3tPDxiBQfWqJepaMpuwxA==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6107f298b023a101bc07fdbb"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"mDBlrG5tT/O24l7tFdUgTw==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"Biased random walk in spatially embedded networks with total cost constraint","authors":["Ruiwu Niu","Gui-Jun Pan"],"date":{"$date":"2016-08-02T00:00:00.000Z"},"pdf_url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/J.PHYSA.2016.05.024","abstract":"We investigate random walk with a bias toward a target node in spatially embedded networks with total cost restriction introduced by Li et al.

Here we augment a hierarchical social network model with communication between and within communities. We argue that organization into communities would decrease overall decentralized search times. We take inspiration from the biological immune system which organizes search for pathogens in a hybrid modular strategy. Our strategy has relevance in search for rare amounts of information in online social networks and could have implications for massively distributed search challenges. Our work also has implications for design of efficient online networks that could have an impact on networks of human collaboration, scientific collaboration and networks used in targeted manhunts. Real world systems, like online social networks, have high associated delays for long-distance links, since they are built on top of physical networks. Such systems have been shown to densify i.e. the average number of neighbours that an individual has increases with time. Hence such networks will have a communication cost due to space and the requirement of building and maintaining and increasing number of connections. We have incorporated such a non-spatial cost to communication in order to introduce the realism of individuals communicating within communities, which we call participation cost. We introduce the notion of a community size that increases with the size of the system, which is shown to reduce the time to search for information in networks. Our final strategy balances search times and participation costs and is shown to decrease time to find information in decentralized search in online social networks. Our strategy also balances strong-ties (within communities) and weak-ties over long distances (between communities that bring in diverse ideas) and may ultimately lead to more productive and innovative networks of human communication and enterprise. We hope that this work will lay the foundation for strategies aimed at producing global scale human interaction networks that are sustainable and lead to a more networked, diverse and prosperous society.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.7906/indecs.14.1.2","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"related_articles_were_imported":false,"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-08-02T13:26:49.777Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"C3tPDxiBQfWqJepaMpuwxA==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6107f299b023a101bc07fdbf"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"IexTDywORniqd1KcomP61g==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"Socially aware integrated centralized infrastructure and opportunistic networking: a powerful content dissemination catalyst","authors":["Jie Hu","Lie-liang Yang","Kun Yang","L.

We consider two scenarios: 1) PUs and SUs are both static; and 2) PUs are static and SUs are mobile. For scenario 1, we show that the primary network throughput is the same for different heterogeneous extents of S-D distribution owing to the flexible assistance of SUs, while the throughput of secondary networks is proven to be changing with the S-D heterogeneity exponent α, which depicts the variation of different heterogeneous extents of S-D distribution. In addition, the delay of both primary and secondary networks are shown to be altering with α. Further, we reveal that the number of SUs required to assist PUs can be dramatically reduced when considering the S-D heterogeneity, while achieving the same primary network throughput. For scenario 2, we utilize a modified uniform mobility (MUM) model to depict the motion of SUs and mainly focus on the analysis of throughput and delay for primary networks. It shows that the primary network throughput is also free of the heterogeneous extent of S-D distribution, while the delay changes with α. Due to the mobility of SUs, a better delay-throughput tradeoff of primary networks is achieved compared with that in scenario 1.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1109/TPDS.2014.2355596","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"related_articles_were_imported":false,"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-08-02T13:26:50.232Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"C3tPDxiBQfWqJepaMpuwxA==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6107f29ab023a101bc07fdc2"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"NT+w+AmDSOqeurdw1UQ/YQ==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"Exploring the Complex Pattern of Information Spreading in Online Blog Communities","authors":["S.

Although numerous previous studies have employed epidemic spreading models to simulate information diffusion, we observe that such models fail to reproduce the realistic diffusion pattern. In respect to users behaviors, strikingly, we find that most users would stick to one specific diffusion mechanism. Moreover, our observations indicate that the social spreading is not only crucial for the structure of diffusion trees, but also capable of inducing more subsequent individuals to acquire the information.

In this work we analyze the social network structure of over 25 million phone users from three countries at three different scales: country, provinces and cities. We consistently find that this last urban scenario presents significant differences to common knowledge about social networks. First, the emergence of a giant component in the network seems to be controlled by whether or not the network spans over the entire urban border, almost independently of the population or geographic extension of the city. Second, urban communities are much less geographically clustered than expected. These two findings shed new light on the widely-studied searchability in self-organized networks. By exhaustive simulation of decentralized search strategies we conclude that urban networks are searchable not through geographical proximity as their country-wide counterparts, but through an homophily-driven community structure.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1038/srep10265","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"related_articles_were_imported":false,"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-08-02T13:26:52.410Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"C3tPDxiBQfWqJepaMpuwxA==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6107f29cb023a101bc07fdc5"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"P4T4ziU2Scq99OQUr4LD5A==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"Impact of country-scale Internet disconnection on structured and social P2P overlays","authors":["Ding Ding","M.

Yet, there have been examples of situations where a country-scale fraction of Internet users have been disconnected from the rest of the network-for instance, when a government cuts connectivity to the outside world as a mechanism for suppression of uprisings. In this paper, we consider the effect of such partitions on topology and routing of structured and social-based unstructured P2P overlays, including a novel social-aware overlay. In particular, we consider nodes within a relatively small fraction of the network (2.5% or fewer Internet users), and study whether users can communicate with their (n-hop away) social neighbors in a peer-to-peer fashion after the partition. We perform an extensive simulation-based analysis to assess the probability for these communications to be possible. In our analysis, we consider both real and synthetic datasets of online social networks. Our results show that structured P2P overlay routability is severely hampered by country-scale partition events. In addition, the proposed social-based unstructured overlay network provides improved routability while maintaining a smaller number of links.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1109/WoWMoM.2015.7158168","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"related_articles_were_imported":false,"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-08-02T13:26:52.412Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"C3tPDxiBQfWqJepaMpuwxA==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6107f29db023a101bc07fdc6"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"cRfUU/mnSAekSWHl5UMBZw==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"Great cities look small","authors":["A.

Supported by validations of gross domestic product and human immunodeficiency virus infection rates across US metropolitan areas, we illustrate the effect of changes in local and city-wide connectivities by considering the economic impact of two contemporary inter- and intra-city transport developments in the UK: High Speed 2 and London Crossrail.

We postulate a model in which an object is selected from a slate of candidates with probability that depends on how far it is (distance) and how many closer alternatives exist (rank). Under a discrete choice formulation, we argue that there exists a factored form in which unknown functions of rank and distance may be combined to produce an accurate estimate of the likelihood that a user will select each alternative. We then learn these hidden functions and show that each can be closely approximated by an appropriately parameterized lognormal, even though the respective marginals look quite different. We give a theoretical justification to support the presence of lognormal distributions. We then apply this framework to study restaurant choices in map search logs. We show that a four-parameter model based on combinations of lognormals has excellent performance at predicting restaurant choice, even compared to baseline models with access to the full (densely parameterized) marginal distribution for rank and distance. Finally, we show how this framework can be extended to simultaneously learn a per-restaurant quality score representing the residual likelihood of choice after distance and rank have been accounted for. We show that, compared to a per-place score that predicts likelihood without factoring out rank and distance, our score is a significantly better predictor of user quality judgments.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1145/2684822.2685300","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"related_articles_were_imported":false,"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-08-02T13:26:57.411Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"C3tPDxiBQfWqJepaMpuwxA==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6107f2a1b023a101bc07fdcb"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"Ms7TfSkEQ8+Kzfl2HxSpQA==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"Navigable networks as Nash equilibria of navigation games","authors":["A.

Despite significant advances that have been made about social networks and human mobility, respectively, our knowledge about the interplay between two layers remains largely limited, partly due to the difficulty in obtaining large-scale datasets that could offer at the same time social and mobile information across a substantial population over an extended period of time. In this paper, we take advantage of a massive, longitudinal mobile phone dataset that consists of human mobility and social network information simultaneously, allowing us to explore the impact of human mobility patterns on the underlying social network. We find that human mobility plays an important role in shaping both local and global structural properties of social network. In contrast to the lack of scale in social networks and human movements, we discovered a characteristic distance in physical space between 10 and 20 km that impacts both local clustering and modular structure in social network. We also find a surprising distinction in trajectory overlap that segments social ties into two categories. Our results are of fundamental relevance to quantitative studies of human behavior, and could serve as the basis of anchoring potential theoretical models of human behavior and building and developing new applications using social and mobile technologies.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1109/JCN.2015.000023","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"related_articles_were_imported":false,"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-08-02T13:27:00.519Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"C3tPDxiBQfWqJepaMpuwxA==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6107f2a5b023a101bc07fdce"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"onDWqXyhT821jGSQKisOuw==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"Scaling Laws of Social-Broadcast Capacity for Mobile Ad Hoc Social Networks","authors":["Yu Fang","Zijiao Zhang","Cheng Wang","Z.

We refer to these social networks as location-based social networks (LBSNs). Location data bridges the gap between the physical and digital worlds and enables a deeper understanding of users’ preferences and behavior. This addition of vast geo-spatial datasets has stimulated research into novel recommender systems that seek to facilitate users’ travels and social interactions. In this paper, we offer a systematic review of this research, summarizing the contributions of individual efforts and exploring their relations. We discuss the new properties and challenges that location brings to recommender systems for LBSNs. We present a comprehensive survey analyzing 1) the data source used, 2) the methodology employed to generate a recommendation, and 3) the objective of the recommendation. We propose three taxonomies that partition the recommender systems according to the properties listed above. First, we categorize the recommender systems by the objective of the recommendation, which can include locations, users, activities, or social media. Second, we categorize the recommender systems by the methodologies employed, including content-based, link analysis-based, and collaborative filtering-based methodologies. Third, we categorize the systems by the data sources used, including user profiles, user online histories, and user location histories. For each category, we summarize the goals and contributions of each system and highlight the representative research effort. Further, we provide comparative analysis of the recommender systems within each category. Finally, we discuss the available data-sets and the popular methods used to evaluate the performance of recommender systems. Finally, we point out promising research topics for future work.

Many research questions frequently addressed via social network analysis are in reality questions about this social space, raising the question of inverting the process: Given a social network, how accurately can we reconstruct the social structure of similarities and dissimilarities? We begin to address this problem formally. Observed social networks are usually multiplex, in the sense that they reflect (dis)similarities in several different “categories,” such as geographical proximity, kinship, or similarity of professions/hobbies.

However, few studies have examined the evolving relationships between physical movements and social closeness evolution. This is partially related to the shortage of longitudinal data in both physical locations and social interactions and the lack of an exploratory analysis environment capable of effectively investigating such a process over space and time. With the increasing availability of sociospatiotemporal data in recent years, it is now feasible to examine the relationships between physical separation and social interactions at the individual level in a space–time context. This research was intended to offer a spatiotemporal exploratory analysis approach to address this challenge. The first step was to propose the concept of a social closeness space–time path, which is an extension of the space–time path concept in time geography, to represent evolving human relationships in a social closeness space. A space–time geographical information system (GIS) prototype was then designed to support the representation and analysis of space–time paths in both physical and social closeness spaces. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed concept and design in gaining insight into the impact of physical migration on online social closeness was demonstrated through an empirical study. The contributions of this study include an extension of the time–geographic framework from physical space to social closeness space, the development of a multirepresentation approach in a GIS to integrate an individual’s space–time paths in both physical and social closeness spaces, and an exploratory analysis of the evolving relationships between physical separation and social closeness over time.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1080/13658816.2014.978869","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"related_articles_were_imported":false,"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-08-02T13:27:05.269Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"C3tPDxiBQfWqJepaMpuwxA==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6107f2a9b023a101bc07fdd3"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"igqY0KdRTsCUnRlA4tOeWQ==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"An Algorithm for Friendship Prediction on Location-Based Social Networks","authors":["Gao Xu-Rui","W.

Our goal in this work is to prove that navigability is an inherent, robust property of many random networks, requiring no augmentation, coordination, or even independence assumptions. Our framework assigns a cost to each edge and considers the uniform measure over all graphs on n vertices that satisfy a total budget constraint.

Despite the potential for impact in a number of fields, several aspects of human mobility networks remain largely unexplored due to the lack of large-scale data at a fine spatiotemporal resolution. Using a longitudinal dataset from the location-based service Foursquare, we perform an empirical analysis of the topological properties of place networks and note their resemblance to online social networks in terms of heavy-tailed degree distributions, triadic closure mechanisms and the small world property. Unlike social networks however, place networks present a mixture of connectivity trends in terms of assortativity that are surprisingly similar to those of the web graph. We take advantage of additional semantic information to interpret how nodes that take on functional roles such as 'travel hub', or 'food spot' behave in these networks. Finally, motivated by the large volume of new links appearing in place networks over time, we formulate the classic link prediction problem in this new domain. We propose a novel variant of gravity models that brings together three essential elements of inter-place connectivity in urban environments: network-level interactions, human mobility dynamics, and geographic distance. We evaluate this model and find it outperforms a number of baseline predictors and supervised learning algorithms on a task of predicting new links in a sample of one hundred popular cities.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1145/2740908.2745402","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"related_articles_were_imported":false,"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-08-02T13:27:11.376Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"C3tPDxiBQfWqJepaMpuwxA==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6107f2b0b023a101bc07fddc"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"6Zy3WsstQYSIF0/WJUbW4A==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"The Forgotten Discovery of Gravity Models and the Inefficiency of Early Railway Networks","authors":["A.

Modern planners rely on methods such as the “gravity models of spatial interaction,” which show quantitatively the importance of accommodating travel demands between smaller cities. Such models were not used in the 19th century. This paper shows that gravity models were discovered in 1846, a dozen years earlier than had been known previously. That discovery was published during the great Railway Mania in Britain. Had the validity and value of gravity models been recognized properly, the investment losses of that gigantic bubble could have been lessened, and more efficient rail systems in Britain and many other countries would have been built. This incident shows society’s early encounter with the “Big Data” of the day and the slow diffusion of economically significant information. The results of this study suggest that it will be increasingly feasible to use modern network science to analyze information dissemination in the 19th century. That might assist in understanding the diffusion of technologies and the origins of bubbles.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.4000/OECONOMIA.1684","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"related_articles_were_imported":false,"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-08-02T13:27:12.559Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"C3tPDxiBQfWqJepaMpuwxA==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6107f2b0b023a101bc07fddd"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"NLVDNCaXSpmuj8BsKA+hrw==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"A Game Theoretic Model for the Formation of Navigable Small-World Networks","authors":["Zhi Yang","Wei Chen"],"date":{"$date":"2015-08-02T00:00:00.000Z"},"pdf_url":"http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2741110","abstract":"Kleinberg proposed a family of small-world networks to explain the navigability of large-scale real-world social networks.

In this paper, we present a game theoretic model for the formation of navigable small world networks. We model the network formation as a game in which people seek for both high reciprocity and long-distance relationships. We show that the navigable small-world network is a Nash Equilibrium of the game. Moreover, we prove that the navigable small-world equilibrium tolerates collusions of any size and arbitrary deviations of a large random set of nodes, while non-navigable equilibria do not tolerate small group collusions or random perturbations. Our empirical evaluation further demonstrates that the system always converges to the navigable network even when limited or no information about other players' strategies is available. Our theoretical and empirical analyses provide important new insight on the connection between distance, reciprocity and navigability in social networks.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1145/2736277.2741110","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"related_articles_were_imported":false,"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-08-02T13:27:12.666Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"C3tPDxiBQfWqJepaMpuwxA==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6107f2b0b023a101bc07fdde"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"uhW31oe1SUSacPi8dCITRQ==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"Coupling human mobility and social ties","authors":["Jameson L.

First, we introduce measures of mobility similarity and predictability and measure them for populations of users in three large urban areas. We find individuals' visitations patterns are far more similar to and predictable by social contacts than strangers and that these measures are positively correlated with tie strength. Unsupervised clustering of hourly variations in mobility similarity identifies three categories of social ties and suggests geography is an important feature to contextualize social relationships. We find that the composition of a user's ego network in terms of the type of contacts they keep is correlated with mobility behaviour.

Human mobility has huge impacts on topics like urban and transportation planning, social and biologic spreading, and economic outcomes. Modeling these processes has however been hindered so far by a lack of data. This is radically changing with the rise of ubiquitous devices. In this chapter, we discuss recent progress deriving insights from the massive, high resolution data sets collected from mobile phone and other devices. We begin with individual mobility, where empirical evidence and statistical models have shown important intrinsic and universal characteristics about our movement: we as human are fundamentally slow to explore new places, relatively predictable, and mostly unique. We then explore methods of modeling aggregate movement of people from place to place and discuss how these estimates can be used to understand and optimize transportation infrastructure. Finally, we highlight applications of these findings to the dynamics of disease spread, social networks, and economic outcomes.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1007/978-3-319-14011-7_2","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"related_articles_were_imported":false,"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-08-02T13:27:13.162Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"C3tPDxiBQfWqJepaMpuwxA==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6107f2b1b023a101bc07fde0"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"AJTgnpE8Ry2MW6hghmDLkg==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"Influence of sociodemographics on human mobility","authors":["Maxime Lenormand","Thomas Louail","Oliva G.

Mobile phone records, geolocated tweets, check-ins from Foursquare or geotagged photos, have contributed to this purpose at different scales, from cities to countries, in different world areas. Many previous works lacked, however, details on the individuals’ attributes such as age or gender. In this work, we analyze credit-card records from Barcelona and Madrid and by examining the geolocated credit-card transactions of individuals living in the two provinces, we find that the mobility patterns vary according to gender, age and occupation. Differences in distance traveled and travel purpose are observed between younger and older people, but, curiously, either between males and females of similar age.

The World Wide Web was responsible for much of this growth and the Workshop on Algorithms and Models for the Web-Graph (WAW) originally started by trying to understand the behavior and processes underlying the Web. It has since outgrown these roots and WAW is now one of the premier venues for original research work that blends rigorous theory and experiments in analyzing data as a graph. We believe that the 12th WAW continues the high standards of the earlier workshops and as a result maintains the tradition of a small, high-quality workshop. \nThe organizers would like to thank EURANDOM, the NETWORKS grant, Microsoft Research, and Google for contributing to the financial aspect of the workshop.

Consequently, most of the research on friendships has provided accuracy at the city level, at best, to designate a user’s location. This study analyses a Twitter dataset because it provides the exact geographic distance between corresponding users. We start by introducing a strong definition of ‘friend’ on Twitter (i.e. a definition of bidirectional friendship), requiring bidirectional communication. Next, we utilize geo-tagged mentions delivered by users to determine their locations, where ‘@username’ is contained anywhere in the body of tweets. To provide analysis results, we first introduce a friend-counting algorithm. From the fact that Twitter users are likely to post consecutive tweets in the static mode, we also introduce a two-stage distance-estimation algorithm. As the first of our main contributions, we verify that the number of friends of a particular Twitter user follows a well-known power-law distribution (i.e. a Zipf’s distribution or a Pareto distribution). Our study also provides the following newly discovered friendship degree related to the issue of space: the number of friends according to distance follows a double power-law (i.e. a double Pareto law) distribution, indicating that the probability of befriending a particular Twitter user is significantly reduced beyond a certain geographic distance between users, termed the separation point. Our analysis provides concrete evidence that Twitter can be a useful platform for assigning a more accurate scalar value to the degree of friendship between two users.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1177/0165551515600136","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"related_articles_were_imported":false,"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-08-02T13:27:19.306Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"C3tPDxiBQfWqJepaMpuwxA==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6107f2b7b023a101bc07fde8"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"dMK1XcwbRgG0x6LRBOiUOQ==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"Mining Human Mobility in Location-Based Social Networks","authors":["Huiji Gao","Huan Liu"],"date":{"$date":"2015-08-02T00:00:00.000Z"},"pdf_url":"https://doi.org/10.2200/S00630ED1V01Y201502DMK011","abstract":"","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.2200/S00630ED1V01Y201502DMK011","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"related_articles_were_imported":false,"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-08-02T13:27:19.876Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"C3tPDxiBQfWqJepaMpuwxA==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6107f2b8b023a101bc07fde9"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"9ks/ylv7SKOP1NPpdotvFQ==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"Geographies of an Online Social Network","authors":["B.

In order to explore this issue the complete network of the former major Hungarian online social network is analyzed. We find that the distance dependence is weaker for the online social network ties than what was found earlier for phone communication networks. For a further analysis we introduced a coarser granularity: We identified the settlements with the nodes of a network and assigned two kinds of weights to the links between them. When the weights are proportional to the number of contacts we observed weakly formed, but spatially based modules resemble to the borders of macro-regions, the highest level of regional administration in the country.

Two recent trends are making this problem harder. First, the increasing popularity of user-generated content and online social networks create and reinforce such popularity distributions. Second, the recent trend of geo-replicating content across multiple points of presence spread around the world, done for improving quality of experience (QoE) for users. In this paper, we analyze and explore the tradeoff involving the “freshness” of the information available to the users and WAN bandwidth costs, and we propose ways to reduce the latter through smart update propagation scheduling, by leveraging on the knowledge of the mapping between social relationships and geographic location, the timing regularities and time differences in end user activity. We first assess the potential of our approach by implementing a simple social-aware scheduling algorithm that operates under bandwidth budget constraints and by quantifying its benefits through a trace-driven analysis. We show that it can reduce WAN traffic by up to 55 percent compared to an immediate update of all replicas, with a minimal effect on information freshness and latency. Second, we build TailGate, a practical system that implements our social-aware scheduling approach, which distributes on the fly long-tail content across PoPs at reduced bandwidth costs by flattening the traffic. We evaluate TailGate by using traces from an OSN and show that it can decrease WAN bandwidth costs by as much as 80 percent and improve QoE.

Topological networks of spatial features are used to explore geographical connectivity and structures. The PageRank algorithm, a network metric, is often used to help identify important locations where people or automobiles concentrate in the geographical literature. However, geographic considerations, including proximity and location attractiveness, are ignored in most network metrics. The objective of the present study is to propose two geographically modified PageRank algorithms—Distance-Decay PageRank (DDPR) and Geographical PageRank (GPR)—that incorporate geographic considerations into PageRank algorithms to identify the spatial concentration of human movement in a geospatial network. Our findings indicate that in both intercity and within-city settings the proposed algorithms more effectively capture the spatial locations where people reside than traditional commonly-used network metrics. In comparing location attractiveness and distance decay, we conclude that the concentration of human movement is largely determined by the distance decay. This implies that geographic proximity remains a key factor in human mobility.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1371/journal.pone.0139509","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"related_articles_were_imported":false,"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-08-02T13:27:21.159Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"C3tPDxiBQfWqJepaMpuwxA==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6107f2bbb023a101bc07fdec"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"ufBO0KYiTHqND97t2aAhHg==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"Semantic geographic space: from Big Data to ecosystems of data","authors":["S.

Many approaches have been developed for identifying communities; these approaches essentially segment networks based on topological structure or the attribute similarity of vertices, while few approaches consider the spatial character of the networks. Many complex networks are spatially constrained such that the vertices and edges are embedded in space. In geographical space, nearer objects are more related than distant objects. Thus, the relations among vertices are defined not only by the links connecting them but also by the distance between them. In this article, we propose a geo-distance-based method of detecting communities in spatially constrained networks to identify communities that are both highly topologically connected and spatially clustered. The algorithm is based on the fast modularity maximisation (CNM) algorithm. First, we modify the modularity to geo-modularity Qgeo by introducing an edge weight that is the inverse of the geographic distance to the power of n. Then, we propose the concept of a spatial clustering coefficient as a measure of clustering of the network to determine the power value n of the distance. The algorithm is tested with China air transport network and BrightKite social network data-sets. The segmentation of the China air transport network is similar to the seven economic regions of China. The segmentation of the BrightKite social network shows the regionality of social groups and identifies the dynamic social groups that reflect users’ location changes. The algorithm is useful in exploring the interaction and clustering properties of geographical phenomena and providing timely location-based services for a group of people.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1080/13658816.2014.999244","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"related_articles_were_imported":false,"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-08-02T13:27:24.172Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"C3tPDxiBQfWqJepaMpuwxA==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6107f2bcb023a101bc07fdee"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"BOvjQujwQ0O7OYeuQN3oTw==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"A general law of human mobility","authors":["X.

In this paper, we propose a group-aware bandwidth management scheme called SmartGW, aiming to minimize the operational cost of the social TV service provider when delivering the group watching service and improve user QoE simultaneously. We formulate the problem into a constrained stochastic optimization problem and exploit the Lyapunov optimization theory to derive the online bandwidth provisioning and allocation strategies.

How the performance of the wireless network will be influenced by the introduction of CR technique has been attracting much attention in past years. While many efforts have been made to study the cognitive radio network, where the data source and the destination (S-D) is homogeneously distributed, the research on cognitive radio networks (CRN) with heterogeneous S-D distribution is still very limited. In this paper, we investigate the throughput and delay scaling law in the heterogeneous cognitive radio network (HCRN), where the S-D pair follows a rank based model and SUs provide relay service for PUs in reciprocating the utilization of PUs' idle spectrum. By applying a cellular TDMA scheduling scheme, we show that the primary network throughput is the same for different heterogeneous extents of S-D distribution owing to the flexible assistance of SUs, while the throughput of secondary networks is proven to be changing with respect to the S-D heterogeneity exponent denoted by α. In addition, the delay scaling are derived for both primary and secondary networks and shown to be altering in accordance with α. Further, we reveal that the density of SUs required to assist PUs can be dramatically reduced when considering the S-D heterogeneity, while achieving the same primary network throughput.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1109/INFOCOM.2014.6848015","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"related_articles_were_imported":false,"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-08-02T13:27:28.298Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"C3tPDxiBQfWqJepaMpuwxA==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6107f2c1b023a101bc07fdf4"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"iMEw7bnvQ8e7bjXoeVu92Q==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"Modelling growth of urban crowd-sourced information","authors":["G.

In this paper, we examine the geospatial attributes of a planetary-scale social network of 240 million people and 1.3 billion edges. We study the interplay among topological, geographical, and algorithmically generated paths connecting pairs of nodes in a social network. Starting in the realm of cyberspace, we find that topologically shortest paths of average length of 6.6 exist between pairs of nodes in the network and that the average degree of separation among nodes is robust to removal of hub nodes. Moving to the realm of locations and distances in geographic space, we find that topologically shortest paths in the social graph grow with increasing geographic distance between path's endpoint nodes. We discover that shortest topological paths are geographically inefficient, but that geography provides an important cue for local algorithmic policies for navigating between source and target nodes. Local algorithmic strategies for navigating the larger network structure in the absence of global navigation procedures have varying success. At the early stages of the navigation, navigating to a hub node helps, while in the middle stage, geography provides the most important clue. While local algorithms for navigating have trouble reaching the target node, they are successful in reaching nodes that are geographically close to the target. Taken together, our results demonstrate a complex interplay between topological and geographical properties of social networks and explain the success of local strategies for navigating such networks.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1109/TCSS.2014.2377789","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"related_articles_were_imported":false,"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-08-02T13:27:35.908Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"C3tPDxiBQfWqJepaMpuwxA==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6107f2c8b023a101bc07fdfa"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"CnS94K+3TQKgBwCGPyoHPQ==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"Using Digital Footprints for a City-Scale Traffic Simulation","authors":["Gavin Mcardle","Eoghan Furey","A.

Traditionally, the data available for traffic simulations come from a population census and dedicated road surveys that only partly cover shopping, leisure, or recreational trips. To account for the latter, the presented traffic modeling framework exploits the digital footprints of city inhabitants on services such as Twitter and Foursquare. We enriched the model with findings from our previous studies on geographical layout of communities in a country-wide mobile phone network to account for socially related journeys. These datasets were used to calibrate a variant of a radiation model of spatial choice, which we introduced in order to drive individuals’ decisions on trip destinations within an assigned daily activity plan. We observed that given the distribution of population, the workplace locations, a comprehensive set of urban facilities, and a list of typical activity sequences of city dwellers collected within a national travel survey, the developed microsimulation reproduces not only the journey statistics such as peak travel periods but also the traffic volumes at main road segments with surprising accuracy.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1145/2517028","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"related_articles_were_imported":false,"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-08-02T13:27:36.097Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"C3tPDxiBQfWqJepaMpuwxA==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6107f2c8b023a101bc07fdfb"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"CaZ2jQTOSaqEUj4UDNvPHQ==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"Cross-Checking Different Sources of Mobility Information","authors":["Maxime Lenormand","M.

Besides its theoretical interest, describing mobility is of great importance for a number of practical applications ranging from the forecast of disease spreading to the design of new spaces in urban environments. While classical data sources, such as surveys or census, have a limited level of geographical resolution (e.g., districts, municipalities, counties are typically used) or are restricted to generic workdays or weekends, the data coming from mobile devices can be precisely located both in time and space. Most previous works have used a single data source to study human mobility patterns. Here we perform instead a cross-check analysis by comparing results obtained with data collected from three different sources: Twitter, census, and cell phones. The analysis is focused on the urban areas of Barcelona and Madrid, for which data of the three types is available. We assess the correlation between the datasets on different aspects: the spatial distribution of people concentration, the temporal evolution of people density, and the mobility patterns of individuals. Our results show that the three data sources are providing comparable information. Even though the representativeness of Twitter geolocated data is lower than that of mobile phone and census data, the correlations between the population density profiles and mobility patterns detected by the three datasets are close to one in a grid with cells of 2×2 and 1×1 square kilometers. This level of correlation supports the feasibility of interchanging the three data sources at the spatio-temporal scales considered.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1371/journal.pone.0105184","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"related_articles_were_imported":false,"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-08-02T13:27:36.375Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"C3tPDxiBQfWqJepaMpuwxA==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6107f2c8b023a101bc07fdfc"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"+LEKgccqRRmmWo99djuxHg==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"Spatial Effects: Transport on Interdependent Networks","authors":["R.

Over 28,000 records of bivalve genera and subgenera from 322 locations around the world have now been compiled by these authors, giving a global record of some 854 genera and subgenera and 5132 species. No fossils are included in the database, but because bivalves have a good fossil record, it is possible to estimate accurately the age of origin of almost all extant genera. It is then possible to plot a backward survivorship curve (8) for each of the 27 global bivalve provinces (9). On the basis of these curves, Krug et al. find that origination rates of marine bivalves increased significantly almost everywhere immediately after the K-Pg mass extinction event. The highest K-Pg origination rates all occurred in tropical and warm-temperate regions. A distinct pulse of bivalve diversification in the early Cenozoic was concentrated mainly in tropical and subtropical regions (see the figure). The steepest part of the global backward survivorship curve for bivalves lies between 65 and 50 million years ago, pointing to a major biodiversification event in the Paleogene (65 to 23 million years ago) that is perhaps not yet captured in Alroy et al.’s database (5, 7). The jury is still out on what may have caused this event. But we should not lose sight of the fact that the steep rise to prominence of many modern floral and faunal groups in the Cenozoic may bear no simple relationship to climate or any other type of environmental change (10, 11).","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1007/978-1-4614-6170-8_100725","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"related_articles_were_imported":false,"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-08-02T13:27:36.775Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"C3tPDxiBQfWqJepaMpuwxA==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6107f2c9b023a101bc07fdfe"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"vX0A0Z4wSzegrXxxQFHFsg==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"A Spatial-Temporal Analysis of Users' Geographical Patterns in Social Media: A Case Study on Microblogs","authors":["C.

In particular, by considering graphs constructed on different network domains, such as rectangular, circular, and spherical network domains, analytical solutions for the average social search delay and the delay distribution are obtained as functions of source–target separation, distribution of the number of long-range connections and geometrical properties of network domains. Derived analytical formulas are first verified by agent-based simulations and then compared with empirical observations in small-world experiments. These formulas indicate that individuals tend to communicate with one another only through their short-range contacts and the average social search delay rises linearly, when the separation between the source and target is small. As this separation increases long-range connections are more commonly used, and the average social search delay rapidly saturates to a constant value and stays almost the same for all large values of the separation. These results do not require the dimensionality of the social space to be identical to the decay exponent of long-range social connections and are qualitatively consistent with experimental observations made by Travers and Milgram in 1969 as well as by others. Moreover, analytical distributions for the delay of social search predicted by the models introduced in this article are also compared with corresponding empirical distributions, and good statistical matches between them are observed. Other somewhat surprising conclusions of the article are that hubs have limited effect in reducing the delay of social search and variation in node degree distribution adversely affects this delay.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1080/0022250X.2011.629062","journal_title":"undefined"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"related_articles_were_imported":false,"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-08-02T13:27:38.184Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"C3tPDxiBQfWqJepaMpuwxA==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6107f2cab023a101bc07fe00"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"SLu1IRqJSOqG6TWxcmbyog==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"Superlinear and sublinear urban scaling in geographical networks modeling cities.","authors":["K.

Our results show that the urban indicator scales superlinearly with the population, namely, Y(N)∝N(β) with β>1, if Y(N) represents a creative productivity and the indicator scales sublinearly (β<1) if Y(N) is related to the degree of infrastructure development.

When we focus on age attribute, based on this theory, online friends tend to have similar age. In this work, we take a step further and study the hypothesis that the age gap between online friends become even smaller in a larger friendship clique. We empirically validate our hypothesis using two real social network data sets. We further design a propagation-based algorithm to predict online users' age, leveraging the clique-based hypothesis.

A model based on these two ingredients reproduces the observed stationary scale-free distributions, which indicates that the development of large networks is governed by robust self-organizing phenomena that go beyond the particulars of the individual systems.</p>","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1126/science.286.5439.509","journal_title":"Science"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"related_articles_were_imported":false,"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-08-02T13:29:33.591Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"ms/nuIe+SVqQNXjvD/lJiw==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"lmaiGzIGSZaRLC71eUL5wQ==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"hr7a+RU1RCqyODQBGkAdSw==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"uLK9FGVDTHGndq3Y6BDNwg==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"45w4Yqu6SNmwSV2Rx/fALQ==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"RTOEyAhgT5+pSu34mhZArg==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"Ik7ia/a9ShG5myVmw8Byfw==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"d8edC5lKQL2UcBDwrNPfEw==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"H21xwDazRxGijJ/fqE41Vw==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"Va1Vm0T/QSmUHY06gzkRRA==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"iEgEJBmSQy6cak9PmJ9M7g==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"82cI0jikRk++Enwi+XoI7Q==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"7QiELvIIQlOf5Ax8Bch0Sg==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"8QtWCx9XTEWYeZi81qx/9A==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"4iTPGEygRAOoWUIGIfLmug==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"g5Bn+P7ZSry7SQK53+OUgQ==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"CxTTCwcETyiwqzjf4GmKmg==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"4xX4f21kSmipJM4a/HY29A==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"2IbZOcXfQseqd6AujeaS6A==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"Amt58nJsTHaqBo8XQND5Mw==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"sHWBfJGhRcSJvABiRxOHkA==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"0xFl2dn4TQ+cxFK1PvPLfA==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"vBIjAMsCQ2GQy1YbX/mvOA==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"jQ/TwhKcQoapfOxUxNy2GA==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"TrXOmsGqREmDdl6wMlTo/A==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"iey7ryJdRRG5mcYEZ7vRYg==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"tFjcwyCnSPigXTmUcSfxQA==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"JCDzdZSYR2OLKD01yZTzGg==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"VLiwSh2dS8SrZrtPCv6fWw==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"7xuscHzKSZ+go19okOSBKQ==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"vbeWEPG6SpmgCNrXpK4QoQ==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"6hwRlWD6SXeR+r+/pwvNVw==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"a9y8g7HZRrC7RgDwndM5qw==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"kgRhn8TRTuKQzolwhw2YqQ==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"KrAA8xQvSD+78EfqUhSjVA==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"wjjhPyxJRsCQoiZusjSbrw==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6107f34bb023a101bc07fe17"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"4Q5XnfEORpOXBQndc73Kew==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"Empirical Analysis of an Evolving Social Network","authors":["Gueorgi Kossinets","Duncan J.

Mutual information (MI) has been frequently utilized for capturing the complete dependence structure including nonlinear dependence. Recently, several methods have been proposed for the MI estimation, such as kernel density estimators (KDEs), $k$-nearest neighbors (KNNs), Edgeworth approximation of differential entropy, and adaptive partitioning of the $XY$ plane. However, outstanding gaps in the current literature have precluded the ability to effectively automate these methods, which, in turn, have caused limited adoptions by the application communities. This study attempts to address a key gap in the literature---specifically, the evaluation of the above methods to choose the best method, particularly in terms of their robustness for short and noisy data, based on comparisons with the theoretical MI estimates, which can be computed analytically, as well with linear correlation and Kendall's $\\ensuremath{\\tau}$. Here we consider smaller data sizes, such as 50, 100, and 1000, and within this study we characterize 50 and 100 data points as very short and 1000 as short. We consider a broader class of functions, specifically linear, quadratic, periodic, and chaotic, contaminated with artificial noise with varying noise-to-signal ratios. Our results indicate KDEs as the best choice for very short data at relatively high noise-to-signal levels whereas the performance of KNNs is the best for very short data at relatively low noise levels as well as for short data consistently across noise levels. In addition, the optimal smoothing parameter of a Gaussian kernel appears to be the best choice for KDEs while three nearest neighbors appear optimal for KNNs. Thus, in situations where the approximate data sizes are known in advance and exploratory data analysis and/or domain knowledge can be used to provide a priori insights into the noise-to-signal ratios, the results in the paper point to a way forward for automating the process of MI estimation.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.1103/PhysRevE.76.026209","journal_title":"Physical Review E"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"related_articles_were_imported":false,"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-08-02T13:29:52.348Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"Va1Vm0T/QSmUHY06gzkRRA==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"0b8q2XIYS2mnih8EzCEf7Q==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6107f3e8b023a101bc07fe31"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"BzPIh7X5SvOZ8N1vujj9sQ==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"Structural Attack to Anonymous Graph of Social Networks","authors":["Zhu, Tieying","Wang, Shanshan","Li, Xiangtao","Zhou, Zhiguo","Zhang, Riming"],"date":{"$date":"2013-11-21T00:00:00.000Z"},"pdf_url":"https://downloads.hindawi.com/journals/mpe/2013/237024.pdf","abstract":"With the rapid development of social networks and its applications, the demand of publishing and sharing social network data for the purpose of commercial or research is increasing.

Furthermore, spam has become a major component of several attack vectors including attacks such as phishing, cross-site scripting, cross-site request forgery and malware infection. Statistics show that the amount of spam containing malicious contents increased compared to the one advertising legitimate products and services. In this paper, the issue of spam detection is investigated with the aim to develop an efficient method to identify spam email based on the analysis of the content of email messages. We identify a set of features that have a considerable number of malicious related features. Our goal is to study the effect of these features in helping the classical classifiers in identifying spam emails. To make the problem more challenging, we developed spam classification models based on imbalanced data where spam emails form the rare class with only 16.5% of the total emails. Different metrics were utilized in the evaluation of the developed models. Results show noticeable improvement of spam classification models when trained by dataset that includes malicious related features.","arxiv_id":null,"doi":"10.4236/ijcns.2015.85014","journal_title":"International Journal of Communications, Network and System Sciences"},"created_by":null,"proposed_to":[],"related_articles_were_imported":false,"id":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2021-08-02T13:32:39.143Z"},"cited_articles":[{"$binary":"NA1NExzKSTG3MycxxTHXTg==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"5cvVyd2kTlaswyavba1GzA==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"iBeAnh5dSimO/l4aJ6zwAA==","$type":"4"},{"$binary":"FJ+O8sE/Q5+saw39L+Vpig==","$type":"4"}]},{"_id":{"$oid":"6107f401b023a101bc07fe3f"},"asset_id":{"$binary":"L4LNRSHjSRqsGk3PxM5D8g==","$type":"4"},"payload":{"title":"Social Network Spam Detection Based on ALBERT and Combination of Bi-LSTM with Self-Attention","authors":["Xu, Guangxia","Zhou, Daiqi","Liu, Jun"],"date":{"$date":"2021-04-08T00:00:00.000Z"},"pdf_url":"https://downloads.hindawi.com/journals/scn/2021/5567991.pdf","abstract":"Social networks are full of spams and spammers.
